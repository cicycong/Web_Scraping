Twitter,2021-05-27T17:41:41+00:00,5,I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion of how they have been treated, but I give twitter 10/10, good service, friendly staff and nice people.
Twitter,2021-05-27T05:33:28+00:00,1,I can't believe Twitter shut me down for no reason, this is ridiculous I did nothing wrong ,not to mention they won't tell me why they permanently suspended me.This is the first time this has ever happened to me😪I even email them they just keep saying the same thing !
Twitter,2021-05-26T20:48:49+00:00,1,I have asked Twitter many times to remove an old photo with inappropriate comments on google search. They will not answer, yet the end of large year they were happy to do it and asked that I just submit an I’d photo. At the time I was really sick so could not answer. They keep telling me to go to help but my question is not there. Never use them they are so hard to do anything for you. Geeks 2U could not even get them to answerGoogle won’t help as they beleive it’s twitters responsibility

Twitter,2021-05-26T11:49:57+00:00,1,I had a case with twitter because my account was falsely accused of impersonation (we are a business account). The person used a hacked verified account then accused us of impersonation.Hacked my personal account, blackmailed me and then I just get bots from twitter and my case gets closed for literally no reason specified.Case #0210033435Twitter then just closes the case without any reason or communication. I'm now up to my third appeal and still haven't reached a human
Twitter,2021-05-26T06:35:55+00:00,1,Wow.. Censorship is real and you can't get a resolution with Twitter.. I made a tweet on the BBC news page saying I am glad Max Verstaffen had beaten Lewis Hamilton in a F1 race.. This fell foul of the twitter police, they put me in twitter jail for a week for an innocent comment.. I suspect it is because twitter are engaged in this black lives matter woke thing and it is now illegal in twitter land to be negative against any black person, so I'm not allowed to support a foreign white racing driver over a black British racing driver... Twitter censorship has gone bonkers.. Don't go there it will make you frustrated, sad and attacked daily by true Bile.. Bile that is allowed from a increasingly far left propaganda blog..
Twitter,2021-05-26T03:12:25+00:00,1,Oh boy where do I go with this review. All I can say is one word. Twitter is....TOXICI sometimes think it’s worse than TIKTOK
Twitter,2021-05-25T11:17:48+00:00,1,What a cesspit Twitter is. A censored hangout for wokeness. I've also advertised on Twitter and just watched my money disappear for nothing! If you use twitter, you are part of the problem.

Twitter,2021-05-24T22:08:24+00:00,1,Same as I rated FB and for the same reasons...the difference is j deleted my Twitter bc I dont have pics and family on there. You choose to cater to terrorist, pedophiles, and satanist who lie, give opinions as facts, and cause harm and destruction to our nation and people but you silence Patriots who love our country, God,and our President Trump. We are silenced for loving freedom, the constitution, and our rights as citizens to refuse the jab. You promote propaganda and misinformation and ban truth, data,, and facts to back it up.  You will be obselete like all the woke actors and emtertainers and sports players no one watches any more. We outnumber you. We are the taxpayers. We are the majority. You helped them steal an election with these tactics along with silencing pedo hunter facts and proof. You are all going to lose everything. We have platforms we can speak truth freely on and will never go back to yours. You committed crimes and it will catch up with you. All of you. We are a constitutional Republic and you all committed treason. But silenced us? For sharing facts? I wish you could have been what you made us believe you were. I will pray for you all. May God have mercy on your souls.
Twitter,2021-05-24T07:30:58+00:00,1,Twitter is no longer a free platform where people can discuss matters openly. It’s hugely censored now and not enjoyable to use
Twitter,2021-05-24T05:48:01+00:00,1,Disgusted . They suspended my account for saying 'throw him under a bus' it's a saying not a literal meaning . They don't understand English sayings . I'm deeply offended as it was referring to the PM it was in the right context saying Dominic Cummings could 'throw him under a bus'. I deleted my account , no free speech is wrong.To throw someone under the bus is to criticize, blame, or punish them, especially in order to avoid blame or gain an advantage. People so thrown are typically in a vulnerable position. The phrase's origin is uncertain, but it likely got its start in British politics, where the phrase "under a bus" was already in use as a metaphor for misfortune or a conveniently-timed accident.
Twitter,2021-05-23T11:35:10+00:00,3,Twitter is one of my favourite platforms due to how much information is at your fingertips at a push of a few buttons and clicks.But this platform has a serious echo chamber problem, its culture is shockingly poor and the company itself does not take complaints of antisemitism seriously.You guys need to improve, you do a lot of good but the reputation is plunging fast.
Twitter,2021-05-21T08:23:27+00:00,3,I always lose followers for no just cause. Last two months I lost up to 400 followers within two days and last night I lost 60 followers. This is not fair at all😞😞
Twitter,2021-05-20T08:57:55+00:00,1,Unfair censorship of people’s freedom of speech and the back of Zionist state.
Twitter,2021-05-19T16:59:48+00:00,1,Twitter are banning and blocking content that is in the favour of Palestinians. Twitter is clearly a platform that does not support freedom of speech. They support apartheid, illegal occupation and murder of innocent people. FREE Palestine
Twitter,2021-05-19T12:33:51+00:00,1,Do the right thing. Be the voice of the oppressed.
Twitter,2021-05-19T11:29:46+00:00,1,This app encourages racisim against Muslims, arabs and specifically against Palestinians. Such a social media should be banned in all countries. They do this just because it's owned by Jewish who hate arabs.

Twitter,2021-05-15T20:14:01+00:00,1,I had a Twitter account upto today. I basically report news stories from all over the world from legitimate news sites.  Because I posted accurate pro-Palestinian news and showed horrific fighting from those on the ground BBC, CNN, Harratz and else where, it was not acceptable, I guess Twitter is so controlled  - you can’t post any legitimate news from the Israelis- Palestinian conflict only Israelis propaganda from the IDF Twitter feed or Jewish organization sites..
Twitter,2021-05-09T11:19:46+00:00,1,Jack Dorsey is the number one bullshxxxer in the world. Anything that suits the rich liberals!
Twitter,2021-05-08T19:30:46+00:00,1,Such a BAD app! And when I want to use it, it F doesn't work!!! Piece of S.
Twitter,2021-05-08T14:44:38+00:00,1,Twitter is suck, and the most of the comunity is sick.Twitter, their team and the support itself, don't even know 1% of what happens with the platform, the funniest: These days I was talking about doing a battle royale with BTS fans, and my tweet was deleted and I was unable to tweet for 9 hours, meanwhile, sick people demonstrate and dominate the site with pedophilia, gore, violence (for real) share sick and disgusting things, and what does twitter do? he simply considers that sick person's tweet to be "inappropriate" but they don't ban it or anything, they get away with it, they don't use twitter except to follow a funny page or something.

Twitter,2021-05-07T01:23:46+00:00,1,Wow 1.5 star average review. Most businesses would go under with that, oh wait they just delete your account if you disagree. My account was froze for saying vp harris should go to the border. come on man. Don't care since I only joined when trump came on board, now no reason to watch woke culture. In 5 years they will be in the same category as blockbuster video, gone. I requested my account to be deleted, they only froze it so they can count my account as active for stupid advertiser's that pay based on amount of users.
Twitter,2021-05-06T06:01:23+00:00,1,Worst social media platform ever! They wrongfully suspend accounts for speaking out against the racist and hateful Tweets that are never removed by Twitter. Twitters  lack of action only encourages hate. App has been deleted from all my devices. I want nothing more to do with them. Just read all the other 1-2 star reviews on here.
Twitter,2021-05-02T17:19:16+00:00,1,terrible platform. if you havent joined twitter already do not waste your time. no support, false bans, terrible updates, etc
Twitter,2021-05-02T07:17:56+00:00,1,Common sense on Twitter has been replaced by authoritarian censorship that causes narrowmindedness, stupid racism, virtue signalling, snowflakes, and people acting like they got a victim complex instead of taking accountability. This platform is filled with people who act like overly emotional children. Also, this platform doesn't let people have online privacy when registering Twitter accounts. Because people will be locked out of Twitter accounts until they give up their phone numbers or government I.D.s. Which tells me this platform has people who put profit over online privacy. Also, this platform goes against open-minded conversations and logical debates through authoritarian censorship. What makes this platform silly is that people can only write Twitter posts less than 280 characters long...
Twitter,2021-05-01T20:57:26+00:00,1,My account was suspended for no reason or no one replied to my case and specify  the X'reason - it's already 1,5 month since then. I opened an account few months ago and mostly just follow few areas which I'm interested. Probably I posted 2-3 times being a Twitter'user.I totally understand that we live this unsecure times and Covid19 has it's own print on it, but this is not an excuse to treat your customers. 👎My rating is: -5*⭐
Twitter,2021-04-30T22:47:46+00:00,1,Think when you divide the country as much as you can.  Run what you think the best and promote racism.    Why your growth stock price the way it’s going.    I closed my account down as no free speech.
Twitter,2021-04-30T11:33:53+00:00,1,Fradulent och political immoralHeavly involved with EVRYONES politics, but at the same time they support and endorse pedohpiles and group harrassment.

Twitter,2021-04-29T00:59:39+00:00,1,Thoroughly stupid. NO Customer serviceNO Customer service. Suspended my account because I logged in on my laptop whereas I usually use my mobile phone. The account is linked to an email address I no longer have. Twitter insists on sending an email to that address and has no other means of solving the problem. I set up a new Twitter account with my new email address but it has linked it back to the old one and will not let me use it without a code sent to the old email address that I did not mention in setting up the account. Thoroughly stupid IT people.
Twitter,2021-04-27T12:54:29+00:00,1,Twitter allows people of colour to post racist crap against white people with no fault whatsoever yet when you go to fight those people stating the racist garbage ypu get freaking censored!!! Twitter is nothing more than a leftie haven now. Absolute garbage. They should not be allowed to censor free speech!!!

Twitter,2021-04-22T16:38:33+00:00,1,Very nasty company who won't "talk" with me at all. Suspended this 68 yr old lady for no reason at all.  I am certainly not a threat or using bad words.  They are horrible - I asked that they cancel my account and they WILL NOT.  They leave my profile there so their stock doesn't go down - I imagine they have thousands of good folks kept this way so their numbers aren't so far down.  I wouldn't use them again for anything in the world.  Suggesting others find a better social media without all the political biase.  Thank you.
Twitter,2021-04-22T14:36:38+00:00,1,suspended by a bot for inaccurate reasons.  i'm disabled and cannot interface with organizations I need to.
Twitter,2021-04-22T00:43:04+00:00,1,Their customer service is absolutely RIDICULOUS. Actually, I won't even call it customer service. It's an automated loop of 'We can't verify that you're the person you say you are' without actually having a HUMAN to talk to. It is ALL through email, no names of a person attempting to help you, and canned messages that aren't even addressed to you. It is an absolute joke. They should be ASHAMED of themselves.
Twitter,2021-04-21T17:25:27+00:00,1,Absolutely the worst customer service ever, they don't answer you anywhere, just pathetic links which won't help you
Twitter,2021-04-18T16:19:36+00:00,1,Twitter censors and are therefore unreliable as a social media source. They should be censured. Dorsey is a pompous ass that should be jailed.
Twitter,2021-04-18T15:38:30+00:00,1,I joined this site as a quick way of receiving news from several other sites, having all the news tweeted to me rather than search the individual sites. I had already set up an account many years ago which I did not use, so I utilised that. I removed the old followed sites and attempted to add the new ones. At that point, instead of getting a welcome greeting off Twitter, I was banned for 3 days for breaching their following policy. Surely the whole point of the site is to follow people?Lets make the ban permanent shall we Twitter? I will help you out by deactivating my account. I don't want to deal with an unwelcoming company, so any money I spend on adverts will be done through Facebook instead. You always were and always will be second best.
Twitter,2021-04-13T03:56:57+00:00,1,twitter sent police to a podcasters home for being tagged in a threatening post, is this something you want to be apart of..... Toxic enviroment to think that after Covid and Ricky Gervais talk on the oscars you think people would be drawn away from fake idols.. This site should be deleted, how was it possible that it literally perma banned a president and people still use it
Twitter,2021-04-12T02:09:25+00:00,5,it doesn't have as many community standards as facebook, fewer ads, a great platform that helps me follow my idol, I feel more comfortable using twitter. Facebook is rubbish

Twitter,2021-04-11T05:09:29+00:00,1,Rosie O'Donnell violated Twitter rules by harassing both sexually and said she was going to bribe politicians for the vote she wanted. How does she get away with this when if a man said those things to a woman or anyone would openly offer a bribe to a public official they would be prosecuted and kicked off Twitter!?
Twitter,2021-04-10T16:05:52+00:00,1,Twitter is the most disgusting and criminal social network in the world. The people who work there violate the rules of the site. My account has been suspended for no reason. I have never exceeded the limit of actions.For more than 50 days, my account has been disabled. Who in the world can stop these villains? All Twitter workers must be prosecuted and punished!
Twitter,2021-04-10T08:32:51+00:00,1,Nothing much more to say, the site is completely "Woke" and will ban, delete and remove anyone who is not a person of colour for racial slurs.I've just been kicked off of the site because I got into an argument with a racist black guy who was all over the site calling various white people all manor of awful racist names. He called me a bunch of horrible disgusting things pertaining to my skin colour and ethnicity and when I responded in kind, I was immediately banned and blocked.I had to write an essay and appeal the decision and it's now been over 2 weeks and I've not even had a reply from them over it. All the while, this black guy who racially abused me is still on site and still abusing other white people. Using terms like "White monkey" "Thin lips" "Mayonnaise face" and other such racial slurs. Yet making comments on his "Black" features in response immediately gets you banned, reported and removed as a racist.This is not how you deal with online abuse and racism. There has to be a zero tolerance approach to it all or none at all. You can't just pick one group of people and say it's against your terms and conditions for them to abuse others and then allow other groups of people to abuse them. This is not how equality and stopping online abuse works.Maybe someone should explain this to Twitter.Racial abuse and online slander is completely allowed on there if you are a POC. All this does is drive a bigger wedge through already frayed racial tensions.I know lots of white people who have been banned for merely standing up for themselves after being racially abused on there, yet Twitter has this view that racial abuse is only racial abuse when it's aimed at POC. There are loads of black people on the site who constantly post racial slurs and attacks and when confronted, they explode into a fit of racial slander, they've been reported and nothing ever gets done about it.Twitter, a site where racism and hatred is not just allowed but encouraged against white people.This is NOT equality.Oh and as a footnote, this is now the 3rd time I have been kicked off of Twitter, the other 2 times were for posting comments about how vile a convicted baby killer was and another about how I thought a serial rapist and murderer deserved the death penalty, Twitters reasoning? I was spreading hate speech. So by thier logic you also have to be nice to murderers, rapists and convicted baby killers. It just shows what this site has become.

Twitter,2021-04-06T20:18:16+00:00,5,So many biased reviewers who think their pet political theory/celebrity is being unfairly treated! Twitter is fine. Yes it's a mob sometimes but gather 300 million people in a social square and give them tools to amplify and discuss anything and there will be some mobbing.Of all the platforms, they probably do the best job of navigating what it means to be an agenda setter who the world's psychological health depends on.
Twitter,2021-04-05T15:28:09+00:00,1,A platform that is comfortable lourding peadophilia over conservative opinions, yes, listen to that for a second... a company that is willing to put children at harm over the anti socialist opinions of Margaret Thatcher
Twitter,2021-04-04T06:13:34+00:00,1,Overwhelmingly horrible, to the point of futility in even having a customer service option on Twitter in the first place. Not even kidding.Appeals are regularly ignored, reports toward pedophiles and white supremacists are ignored, and suspensions are permanent without reason.If you'd like to use Twitter, be warned! Customer Service regularly makes me contemplate forsaking all worldly desires and living as a monk somewhere in South Asia. It induces that much suffering, with its wall of automated responses for months on end.
Twitter,2021-04-01T16:30:50+00:00,1,Twitter just sucks period. Censorship like you wouldn't believe. Why would anyone sign up to this? Close your account and send their share price through the floor where it belongs. No one tweeting.... goodbye Twitter. Your days are numbered as a social media platform.

Twitter,2021-03-26T19:16:58+00:00,1,A politically biased and anti-social network. One more toys made by CIA to monitor and control the society. It was built around an artificial intelligence algorithm to facilitate the tracking, for that reason allow only short messages (forcing the user to be objective), has the follow system (allowing to track what are the subjects one is interested, and who is following) and hashtags (where people show what they support). Promotion of drugs, communism and bizarre ideas is allowed, while those voicing against are persecuted and banned. Twitter itself became for many a kind of drug, an anti-social drug.
Twitter,2021-03-26T16:04:09+00:00,1,Probably the worst social media app. That's all.
Twitter,2021-03-26T07:23:07+00:00,1,They are quick to take down any posts they deem to be inappropriate but are somehow unable to take down kiddie loving posts even when evidence has been presented to them that certain images and posts contain illegal content of/about minors.There are currently multiple lawsuits about theses issues and some of the illegal content is still readily available to the view.Sort out your priorities Jack Dorsey!

Twitter,2021-03-21T22:35:11+00:00,1,A toxic platform with many toxic people. You'll be attacked if your opinion doesn't match theirs and they will cancel you instantly with help from the not-very-professional algorithm & jack dorsey. One sided, therefore incomplete and very boring. If you get high on hatred, this is the platform for you. I'm not going back there if I got paid for it.

Covid19 is no more contagious or deadly than flu, yet if you say this you asked to fully identify yourself (presumably so they can inform the police) and delete all your offensive posts.My account (@Covid19isALie) has been suspended (but not deleted yet) as I refuse to accept that my viewpoint is not valid in any open discussion on the subject. Unfortunately Twitter do not accept this point of view.
Twitter,2021-03-20T08:21:10+00:00,1,how pathetic, recently started using twitter and i get notifications which dont even tell me the comment someone is replied to, literally how on earth are you ment to remember everything you wrote and exactly which bit they are replying to if there is nowhere to click to send you to the original tweet or comment, twitter is by far one of the dumbest platforms i ever used.
Twitter,2021-03-17T08:33:27+00:00,1,Twitter has become a dumpster over the years. Everyone is posting literally anything on it I wonder if Twitter is doing anything about content moderation. You can literally post porn, racist even child pornography on it but Twitter has done anything about it. Twitter will only remove content if it's reported by the user itself people are posting such content on Twitter like it's a dark web. Twitter needs to invest more in content moderation.
Twitter,2021-03-16T06:40:48+00:00,1,Ok then. When your mentally ill friend commits suicide, don’t go crying talking about “WhY dIdN’t S/hE jUsT tAlK tO mE???”BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT A THERAPIST. DUH!Since so many people have that extremely selfish belief on Twitter, I’ll just rate the site one star. There are too many s**tty people on there anyway. It’s full of so many godd*mn preachy ass mfs. I’m tired of people pretending to care about mental health. It doesn’t matter if you’re a therapist or not, your friend probably can’t access therapy and just need someone to talk to. Imagine someone who is suicidal reading garbage s**t like that, and finally deciding to take their own life. Congratulations you selfish sons of b*tches!
Twitter,2021-03-15T02:11:08+00:00,1,Totally useless and distracting ... if you remember the Oscars.Not a lot of people follow you or interact, you have to be a celebrity to actually find it useful.
Twitter,2021-03-12T19:03:57+00:00,1,Twitter has become the dictator, judge, and jury of their inconvenient truth! They use the technicality of the law to justify their immoral decision to censor content simply because they want to interfere with the American peoples access to information and ideas. Over time their censorship will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open Internet. Twitter has become the publisher of the content posted. There are legal consequences to what they are doing.Law Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act It states.(c) Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material(1) Treatment of publisher or speakerNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.So it’s time for the big social media giants to finally choose if they are a publisher or a platform. No matter what kind of legal weasel words they choose to use to justify their decisions. It doesn’t matter if it’s a human or a machine algorithm making the editorial decision – if you are blocking or censoring some content that doesn’t agree with your values and viewpoints, then you are a publisher. Period. It’s time for social media companies to wake up to that reality and be prepared for the consequences.
Twitter,2021-03-12T03:24:22+00:00,1,I am giving my own experience on twitter bans saying your account has been suspended for using automated scripts etc even you don't use it. Even you haven't violated any terms listed in policy. You can get suspended for aggressive tweets, retweets, likes, following etc which means that even if you do things manually you still will be get suspended. Well there is no pointing restriction documentation in twitter that you can follow like 10 users a day or 10 tweets /retweets per day. Which leads users to reach limit without knowing the limit for ban. And you finally get your account suspended. I think twitter should update their documentation with their actual suspending policy and algorithm. For now I can only rate it one star for poor documentation and poor support system. Hope it will improve some day.
Twitter,2021-03-11T04:15:32+00:00,4,I like this website highly recommended!!!
Twitter,2021-03-10T06:25:52+00:00,3,Nice great for keeping touch with social activities
Twitter,2021-03-04T00:30:42+00:00,1,I think the Twitter app is crap, I just applied and already had two login failures and one account suspension
Twitter,2021-03-02T22:06:09+00:00,1,Twitter disabled my account because I had an opinion.it wasn't offensive or aggressive.Twitter seems to to adopt Totalitarian policy !They should be Closed Down and Shamed !!!
Twitter,2021-02-26T20:10:47+00:00,4,A good social network platform to promote and interact with the world. But nothing compared to Facebook.
Twitter,2021-02-26T16:59:03+00:00,5,Simply the best platform for what’s currently happening around you. Looking forward to new features
Twitter,2021-02-23T06:49:55+00:00,1,Deleting my account due to the cancel-culture, and violation of free speech policies that Twitter has adopted
Twitter,2021-02-22T21:31:02+00:00,1,Nothing but an echo chamber.Bans are handed out like lollipops to anyone who has a slightly different view to twitters political narrative.I was banned for having a famous anti-nazi, historical photograph (August Landmesser) with twitter claiming it to be "hateful imagery". 6 weeks and several appeals later and still no response. The same photo is published on twitter by international historical societies, mainstream media, universities and Jewish organisations, some dating back to 2009. I am of Jewish heritage myself.Child porn is fine though... Reeks of Fascism to me just without the ultra-nationalist part.Don't bother.
Twitter,2021-02-21T15:14:58+00:00,1,One of the worst support teams ever. Comments seem to be reported and deleted following some agenda.I have seen comments that had nothing really wrong with them getting deleted as well as the other end of the spectrum, comments from obvious fake accounts with links to phising websites taking weeks to be deleted, if they even get deleted.Its sad.
Twitter,2021-02-21T05:06:36+00:00,1,Wish I could give "zero" stars.  Worst platform ever.  Censorship and you can only post their narrative or your shadow banned, action limited or suspended all together.   Don't even bother using Twitter.  Go to Gab, Parler, CloutHub to name a few.
Twitter,2021-02-21T02:52:59+00:00,1,Twitter is run by Anti-American Communists.   The blatant bias against conservatives is sickening and should terrify every thinking American.   I'm not sorry I dumped my account and just wish I could give you zero stars.
Twitter,2021-02-17T20:39:58+00:00,1,...no stars! They do not allow "freedom of speech/written or otherwise"!
Twitter,2021-02-17T15:20:01+00:00,3,I find this funny as all hell.  I have been banned for LIFE off Twitter!   Im not here crying like a lil baby!  FREE SPEACH! LOL  Funny how everyone here is crying about "free speech"  and that they love and know our countries LAWS. Just know we all clicked "ACCEPT" to their terms and conditions that's the bottom line.  Not sure if crying makes ya feel better but toughen up buttercup there's plenty of other sites to spew your hate and misinformation! Unlike most of you, my beef is for them just to tell me why I'm banned but my request has fallen on deaf ears.  Probably something to with me bashing on Trump and his horrible admin.   Oh Well the election is now over ( Thank God).....  I got better things to do than sit on social media all day any hoot Now that your banned go do something with your lives instead of crying about a company we all clicked agree to!
Twitter,2021-02-17T00:54:19+00:00,1,Deleting my account due to the cancel-culture, and violation of free speech policies that Twitter has adopted.
Twitter,2021-02-16T23:28:25+00:00,1,Somebody logged my account but I not agree
Twitter,2021-02-16T00:17:00+00:00,1,DISCUSTING COMPANY TWITTER, BIAST AND HATERS OF THE TRUTH AND FREE SPEACH.They want people to carry on spreading Covid-19 around the world, i posted to stop people spreading covid and they said the post was spam.TWITTER and the CEO, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS AND PARTNERS are in my opinion allowing covid to kill people.STAY AWAY, SELL YOUR SHARES, REMOVE YOUR ADDS.
Twitter,2021-02-13T19:39:30+00:00,1,If there was a no star I would have rated that option. You might have heard of how the Native Indians who were the sole land owners of America look at where they are now , lands grabbed the indo people killed by the immigrants called Americans nowadays that is genocide. am a Tamil from #tamileelamI am a Tamil from #tamileelam, not #srilanka. @instagram stop banning and censoring #tamileelam #eelam you are suppressing the right to self-determination and the freedom of expression. This is a form of discrimination. Please don’t continue or take part in government decisions/ complaints you should make your own  research and feedback according to your policy in the (Tamil community) interest. There is two sides of the story my Tamil community is hit very severe at the moment.
Twitter,2021-02-10T18:58:14+00:00,1,Would have given a zero. Your censorship is appalling.  Huge waste of time and space!
Twitter,2021-02-10T16:13:45+00:00,1,Looks like twitter is afraid of unbiased facts. Whose the fools here. Shutting accounts that actually speak some truth. It goes both ways twitter, keep losing money and start charging the fools left to sit around and agree with each other. Karma always comes back to hit you in the pockets. Twitter is a joke.
Twitter,2021-02-09T19:34:23+00:00,1,Do not trust reviews on Trustpilot, they all are fake.
Twitter,2021-02-09T17:29:29+00:00,1,Twitter clearly doesn't care about advertisers. I had it blow through my entire budget within 1 day. When I tried to reach out to support, it was just bots, and then I was told that there was nothing they could do about it. Never actually reached a live person. Now, I'm running another campaign, and I'm getting zero results. Got another bot. Followed up with a screenshot of what's going on, and there's still hasn't been a response. From here on out, I'm not recommending this platform to any of my customers. It's terrible.
Twitter,2021-02-09T17:07:34+00:00,1,EXTREMELY FAR LEFT VEIWS ONLY.FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT EXIST ON TWITTER.
Twitter,2021-02-09T13:58:38+00:00,1,Heavily engaged in voter manipulation and suppression of truth.Twitter's agenda is to push neomarxist propaganda on things like Covid, racism and climate change.If you don't play along, your account can disappear in an instant.
Twitter,2021-02-09T07:16:12+00:00,1,You will be thought-policed and banned if you don't follow their 'progressive' agenda. This place is run by unamerican tyrannical fascist ideological zealots who hate free speech.
Twitter,2021-02-08T00:45:34+00:00,1,A little birdie just informed me that Twitter will falsely suspend and terminate you if you call out pedophilia or that "film" Cuties (which was made solely for child predators to engage in pedophilia and has no arguable artistic, literary, scientific, political, cinematic, medical, religious, governmental, or judicial value), but will keep up the degenerate, mentally stunted, braindead morons who still have the gall to defend Pedoflix's deformed crotchspawn, the worst film movie of all time on an objective level.Considering that they are currently being sued for having actual child porn, claiming it "doesn't violate their terms of service" whilst blocking an investigation/report from an actual victim and SUSPENDING THE ACCOUNTS OF TWO VICTIMS OF A PEDOPHILE, it goes to show that just like that now corrupt P.O.S. streaming service, this is the straw that's finally broken the camel's back. Just like Pedoflix, Twitter is trying to NORMALIZE AND LEGALIZE PEDOPHILIA, CHILD PORN, CHILD MOLESTATION, CHILD RAPE, AND CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING, and it is an evil, grotesque, sick, twisted, malformed website that needs to be shut down and put out of business.Jack Dorsey, (more like J@ck-off D!ckey) the disgusting neckbearded jack@$$ who is the CEO and anyone who is in charge of this corrupt website needs to get their computer, hard drive, and phone confiscated by the police and FBI, lose the rights to have children or have their children taken by child services out of their custody, they are all evil, immoral, Satanic people, devils in human skin who don't belong in society.I'm not surprised though, considering the numerous amounts of pedophiles (dubbing themselves "MAPs", aka "Minor Attracted Person", a sugarcoated term for pedophile they use to try to destigmatize their illness and act like a protected, persecuted group) it has and it took them TOO LONG to finally put out rules forbidding that type of content that they still have no obligation to follow.It's no wonder people are leaving it in the dust, and I too shall take my leave.P.S., Don't listen to "Truthbetold", he must either be someone who works for Twitter itself or is on their payroll.
Twitter,2021-02-07T23:52:27+00:00,1,Hypocrisy at its finest...along with millions I will never use this site again. So many double standards, may you continue to lose accounts. Democrats are nothing more than a bunch of narcissistic hypocrites. So many hypocritical double standards. Actions  such as cancel culture is what's deviding America. Karma Karma Karma
Twitter,2021-02-06T19:08:35+00:00,1,I've never been able to create an account with them using my email or phone.Account creation always gets stuck at step 3.Support requires logging into an account i don't have.Tried using the reset password thing for both email and phone in case someone else used my info but neither sends anything to phone or email.Another annoying thing is you can't search Twitter without logging in so if someone created a fake account i can't even see what's been posted.
Twitter,2021-02-06T17:32:34+00:00,1,Very controlling they suspended me without reason and didn't tell me how long just perminently suspended. Have suspended every account I've made now for absolutely no reason. Soon as I make a account they suspend it. They have blocked my IP or phone and computers. Twitter needs to be sued like FACEBOOK. We need a American twitter where freedom of speech isn't put down because of bad politics. I tried over 30 times to appeal and just get a answer as to why and they REFUSE to reply months later and now in my 4 the account and I didn't even do anything to break the rules. I got it the first time. But it's racist to continue to block someone for no reason. Then immigrants get mad when we do it to them. What a joke twitter is.
Twitter,2021-02-05T16:52:04+00:00,1,Deleted my account! Censoring people's freedom of speech on a site where all people do is express their views was the dumbest move ever! Screw Twitter!
Twitter,2021-02-05T03:52:41+00:00,1,Fascist terrible site. Contributing to the destruction of this country.
Twitter,2021-02-04T02:05:23+00:00,1,TWITTER AND FACEBOOK IS GETTING MORE EXPOSED THANKS TO PROJECT VERITAS. HARD LEFT COMMUNIST PARTY FULL OF CENSORSHIP AND HATE SPREADING AGAINST TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE. DICTATOR DORSEY AND HIS BUDDIES AT BIG TECH LIKE MARK C*CKZUCKERBERG ARE ALL BEING EXPOSED.
Twitter,2021-02-03T20:13:34+00:00,5,Beautiful elegant awesome platform of light! I have used this site for years. May God Bless such genius 🙏
Twitter,2021-02-03T07:07:38+00:00,1,I confess I never owned a Twitter account, and I'm glad I didn't because I can tell just from watching what people do on there that this website  Is a cesspit.  A cesspit created by a Communist Leftist CEO who only believes in free speech for himself and his kind. Jack Dorsey is a Communist piece of garbage  Who openly sensors and attacks conservatives  and I  Look forward  for the day that he is arrested. If not, death is better.  There is a special place in hell for evil men like him!  May everything involved with Twitter and that CEO go up in flames.All Twitter does is encourage Intolerance . There is no free speech on there.
Twitter,2021-02-03T05:41:33+00:00,1,Censorship of only conservative and promotion of liberal ideology. Promotion of Trump hate and suppression of Trump support!
Twitter,2021-02-02T19:40:08+00:00,1,They don't won't to help...They have no why to contact them.
Twitter,2021-02-02T04:44:07+00:00,1,HORRIBLE SITE !follow the rule's, posted a ton but was Ignored on every 1 of my tweet's, 99.9999% of My Tweet's are IgnoredNo Heart's No Interaction's, No One even dare's say hi to me and i Wonder if once again i was Shadow banned.i Try'ed to Interact with other's wondering if that is how to get Traffic to your Profile like even 10 Heart's but Naw ! i got Nothin .... w t fi See people Saying and doing more Bat S hit thing's then me and people follow and Heart them but me .... i Get Ghosted or Hidden ?
Twitter,2021-02-01T18:14:55+00:00,1,Lost customer- Twitter is obsolete- too many haters and now twitter has decided to discriminate and censor if they do not like what political party you are with- they shut you down BUT they do not shut down child trafficking sites and videos - they do not shut down terrorists accounts - They need to be shut down NOW!!
Twitter,2021-02-01T12:20:18+00:00,1,Shuts down all opposition to its own political ideology but allows and actively defends child porn... welcome to the communist left.
Twitter,2021-02-01T03:29:51+00:00,1,Twitter permanently suspended my account without a specific explanation. They said i violated TOS with spam or platform manipulatio. (I did neither) They did not cite a specific tweet, they have not responded to my appeal, and they will not allow me to delete the account while suspended. On bbb.org there were ocmver 14,500 complaints on twitter's profile about a week ago. Checked today and there are ZERO. CONSPIRACY NO MORE.
Twitter,2021-01-30T23:42:07+00:00,1,Done being censored.   Who can tell me what I am allowed to view!!!
Twitter,2021-01-30T05:54:38+00:00,1,Free speech police. Already deleted my account.
Twitter,2021-01-30T05:35:04+00:00,1,Awful. Remove it
Twitter,2021-01-29T11:06:05+00:00,1,If you sneeze wrong they will kick you off for not sneezing correctly.Imagine saying the wrong word!Now imagine how many people are kicked off daily!!!Now imagine those people signing up again under different names!!Its just a big waste of time and effort!!F u c k you the people that run twitter!
Twitter,2021-01-28T18:47:38+00:00,1,Wish I could give 0 stars. Communist company. Garbage service and deceptive practices.
Twitter,2021-01-28T15:26:50+00:00,1,I would prefer not to give a star I will be unfairly suspended deprivation of liberty no indication what or possibility to adjust you cannot even delete account my advice stay away from here only 1 opinion can be shared really very sad done with Twitter now coming off the platform
Twitter,2021-01-28T03:29:51+00:00,1,What a horrible person to suspend people simply because you don't like his/her views.Sounds so much like Hitler's thoughts. He didn't like, he suspended the people.You're a complete ass.Karma!!!!!
Twitter,2021-01-27T23:52:00+00:00,1,If you want a leftist vacuum twitter is your platform. Absolutely no diversity of opinions
Twitter,2021-01-26T19:11:37+00:00,1,Absolute idiotic social media. Algorithms locks your account and doesn't even give you the right to delete whatever cause the lock..... Freedom of speech? Not really with them..... avoid this social media!
Twitter,2021-01-26T17:21:56+00:00,1,Shame I can’t put 0 stars! Which would be fitting for a platform that censors or bans people from free speech.Platforms like this need to understand you’re not the government nor do you make the decisions on people’s rights. We have the freedom of speech for a reason otherwise we might as well live in a socialist state in which you i@@@ts are turning countries in to. Stay out of politics and serve the people
Twitter,2021-01-26T17:16:42+00:00,1,Can't get any info from them as to why they are blocking accounts other than opinions and beliefs being different than their left wing liberal views.Why aren't they blocking or banning accounts of Democrats who made statements about Sleepy Ass Joe winning the election? 3825 Twitter!!!!
Twitter,2021-01-25T21:36:45+00:00,1,Seriously? Are you that uneducated? There is no US Corp. anymore! It’s been officially declared bankrupt. Washington DC is foreign entity on US soil. Everything is currently being staged and Twitter are the puppets! Biden is the president of Washington DC, NOT USA!! Hence why the troops are there keeping them captive and barb wires put up. Don’t believe me? Watch the inauguration (pre taped by CNN) and pay close attention to the women’s shoes!! Trump left in Air Force One, Biden showed up in a private jet (so much for your carbon footprint). You make me and 80 million (and growing) other real Americans giggle! 👊🏼 Who do you think you are? Allowing sex trafficking child porn videos but god for f****** bid you talk like a conservative, a normal human being! Douchebags!! #firstamendment #secondamendmemt bang bang b****!
Twitter,2021-01-25T15:31:19+00:00,1,They literally don't have a support department. If they're unable to deal with the number of support requests then they need to hire more staff or implement a better system and sack whoever is running it now... or just don't bother having a support department.
Twitter,2021-01-23T23:40:26+00:00,1,Twitter unfortunately no longer represents letting people legitimately express their opinions, but have been hijacked by ideological editorial staff and management team.That is their prerogative but I have decided to no longer contribute content or source my news from Twitter, especially with the latest revelations of failure to remove child porn, which is actually a substantially harmful aspect which SHOULD BE CENSORED (yet they refuse to).Corporations like to talk about ESG, environmental, social and governance standards. As both a user and an investor, this is a major failure on Twitter’s part.
Twitter,2021-01-23T23:11:08+00:00,1,TWITTER ALLOWS CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.  IT ISN'T AGAINST THEIR POLICIES APPARENTLY.  BOYCOTT, BOYCOTT, BOYCOTT...A recent complaint from the victim in a video, his mother and several following, made no difference.  Only after seeking help from the legal sector, has it been taken down and they are now suing the disgusting site.
Twitter,2021-01-23T21:49:43+00:00,1,Trashy garbage rude employees. My account was hacked and some censored content was posted in my account and they closed my account and refused to reopen it! I hope to watch this company fall to the ground.
Twitter,2021-01-23T14:52:50+00:00,1,almost everything i see in twitter is downright inhumane and im honestly shocked that this scummy platform has not been taken down comletely , ive seen pedofelia racism doxxing and much more and this garbage platform turns a blind eye to all of it .its disgusting.
Twitter,2021-01-23T03:38:42+00:00,5,Good experience but starting to feel a lot like Facebook, Instagram... Tumblr.I like it and will still keep it though.
Twitter,2021-01-22T20:26:27+00:00,1,I would go less if possible...    child porn is NEVER acceptable on any platform on any day  or in any way!!   Victimizing a assault victim is unacceptable  but when it involves a child being the victim you should be ashamed for even posting a story.
Twitter,2021-01-22T05:00:35+00:00,3,None
Twitter,2021-01-22T02:59:18+00:00,1,This used to be a great social media platform where a business was able to connect with the world! Censorship is unacceptable! When you can’t say what you want to say, the platform will become useless and the world will be looking for a new platform!! Bye Twitter!!
Twitter,2021-01-21T17:49:28+00:00,1,i used to love Twitter but it has become a very one sided platform - doesn't censor really bad things but censors a lot of honesty.
Twitter,2021-01-21T16:26:12+00:00,1,None
Twitter,2021-01-21T16:10:07+00:00,1,I am really disappointed in Twitter for its continued targeting of conservative voices. So my complaint is directed at Twitter itself and their moderators. The shameful actions you have taken completely undermine what this country was built upon. Having different ideas and expressing them are complete supports to our foundation as a country. I and fully half of our US population are incredibly disappointed by your actions and hope you change your ways. At some point you and your employees/followers may be silenced and when that happens, who will then stand with you? Stop the censorship to opposing views.
Twitter,2021-01-21T06:59:00+00:00,1,Sick of the obviously biased censorship of free speech by leftists. Big tech needs to be held accountable for influencing elections by suppressing anything that makes Dorseys obvious choice look bad and banning anyone who posts against their narrative. This IS an attack on free speech and MEDDLING in an election. 100% a threat to democracy.
Twitter,2021-01-20T18:28:32+00:00,1,I would give it a zero if I could :) I deleted my Twitter account recently, Facebook is gone too. Once they start censoring, taking political sides, opposing free speech, they have to go. Watch them become irrelevant soon
Twitter,2021-01-20T11:52:18+00:00,2,I don't see any point using it. I gave it a try, but the boredom and fake accounts got me closing it down
Twitter,2021-01-19T22:09:55+00:00,1,Any company who thinks banning the president of the united states is okay, is  pure garbage. I hope the ceo gets explosive diarrhea during a meeting
Twitter,2021-01-19T21:40:31+00:00,1,Due to the left wing radical agenda of oppressing Americans I have cancelled my account!
Twitter,2021-01-19T20:20:16+00:00,1,Falsely bans accounts for no reason at all, support non existent and refuse to help you and sometimes refuse to respond at all.
Twitter,2021-01-19T17:24:20+00:00,1,Personally i have never used the service, this isn't about your service but rather your inability to think and react based on common sense rather than greed and ignorance.  You support hate (fueling the riots in the capital along with a long line of bs) and the theft of your rights and freedoms, yet profited from those rights and freedoms, that makes you and your organization hypocrites as well as traitors to your own country.  You are a sad excuse for progression along with the rest of you social media flunkies and should be left out to rot with the rest of the democratic trash, favoring terrorism over freedom, dictatorship over choices, you have failed yourselves and your country.

Twitter,2021-01-19T04:58:45+00:00,1,Twitter is the absolute worst social media platform in the world ! They suspend people's accounts over little and nothing as well as very negligible things.My Twitter account @KSybaritic was recently suspended for no valid reason at all on Saturday January 9th ,2021 and despite the fact that I have made countless appeals, I still haven't gotten a single response and it has now been well over a week and counting. This is an experience  that innumerable other users have unfortunately encountered. Twitter doesn't care at all about their users and has the most abysmal customer service that I have ever seen in my life ! They only want to exploit their users for profit ,and then discard as well as ostracize them as soon as they inevitability show there imperfections as a human being .They use a completely flawed algorithm and bots to frequently suspended, scrutinize ,spy on ,and ban people from Twitter. Twitter incessantly changes their  rules  all the time so one thing that wouldn't get you reprimanded one moment can readily have that happen in another . Jack Dorsey needs to be fired as their CEO as soon as possible ! He is a social media dictator who engenders unmitgated limitations to people's freedom of speech . Twitter has become analogous to the Orwellian novel of 1984 since they behave just like Ingsoc, The Thought Police and Jack Dorsey is a scruffy,ignorant, and ,glorified hippie Big Brother wannabe/reject . I definitely wouldn't recommend Twitter to my worse enemy because it has become a virtual dystopian society . Users are certainly sooner or later going to abandon Twitter en masse in search of other social media venues that actually foster freedom of thought as a volitional right . Twitter offers a patheticly ersatz and entirely poor imitation of and dearth of freedom. They will not last another 10 years as a company at this rate. They should be ashamed of themselves and are a consummate disgrace to the social media community ! I hope and pray that this negative review will help and convince people not to waste their valuable time to create a Twitter account with this very callous ,corrupt, dictatorial,  avaricious, and autocratic company  ! They are so replete with corruption  that as of this writing you can't  even post an honest  positive or  negative review about them on Google reviews without getting an error message, and Yelp for Twitter is nonexistent. There needs  to be laws enacted and implemented that keep scrofulous social media companies like Twitter  from becoming  despotic by flagrantly abusing their powers . Users  need to have rights  that prevent them from being oppressed by Twitter.
Twitter,2021-01-19T04:25:54+00:00,1,Terrorists, traitors, Fraudulent, unconstitutional!
Twitter,2021-01-18T05:50:41+00:00,1,Twitter at one time was a excellent social media outlet. Unfortunately they cower to foreign governments and pander to special intrest groups and the media to deflect the fact that they are hypocrits and have a double standards when it comes to censoring people and political groups. They have no respect for people's rights or voices. They claim the higher ground when censoring people and the fact that they only hire those people who promote thier narrative. There are so much better apps out there.
Twitter,2021-01-18T04:16:39+00:00,1,RIP Twitter. The people have Parler and Mewe and Gab will tweet that freedom is the American dream that will not be silenced or give in to your marxist socialism anarchy.The Great, Social media Exodus, has begun. Facebook and Twitter are falling, as millions across the world are now joining alternative social media platforms away from spying eyes, the misuse of information, and censorship. People are looking for reliable facts on every subject and truthful coverage of events without the hype and hysteria of mass media controlled by billionaires with ulterior agendas. Even Elon Musk has taken the plunge, not only from social media but also from Silicon Valley renouncing the Californian dream in pursuit of Texas truth and happiness.The death of Facebook and Twitter has shocked the world. How can such gentle giants become so cold? A $50 billion drop of revenue in one day, was that market pain, forewarning an imminent heart attack shadowing in the dark.  Why is it so shocking?  Because they were the champions of old the fake news media told. They have aggressively and arrogantly grown to dominate the market, even as recently seen, by collaborated efforts with Apple, Amazon, and Google they deplatformed their competitive rival Parler, in a final attempt to silence a President and prevent an unprecedented Exodus to a promised land.Attacks on other platforms like GAB have also been fierce and fueled New York Times fabricated lies. But Gab's creature did not rely on Amazon or Google to host their precious gem.If you think it is hard to say die and goodbye, then I encourage you to read my Dear Facebook. No doubt you may feel some sorrow, and no need to take those happy pills pushed by WHO and Pharma. But it will get better, as you go along making new friends, who have your best interest at heart behind the scenes.Gab and Mewe are the new Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube combined.  Gab also offers Gab.tv which will be your newtube to watch and see. Another alternative tube platform worth mentioning is Bitchute.Signal endorsed by Edward Snowden and Telegram offers safe and private messaging away from Bigtech's spying eyes. All of the above offers apps, and easy PC web control.And for accurate NEWS and truthful reporting, you can now watch the proudly American NewsMaxTv or read the Epochtimes. Join them free for it is going to get wild. No longer can you rely on CNN, NY Times, or mainstream content. China's is virus comes in all forms and shapes. Shift your mindset and take control of what you drink and eat from leftist Media.For example, Facebook fact-checking friends are linked to socialist Marxist groups, and thus would not think twice to spread mis-and-disinformation while holding their lawless, points of view as a way to suppress free speech and flow of information.Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon CEO's have all steered their high-tech platforms towards a socialist regime, and have done so forcefully by blocking content and removing factual news, even deplatforming individuals and opposing media into exile. There are a rising number of people who are disenfranchised by the current flow of lies, propaganda, and mass hysteria caused by marxist media.The Great Exodus from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube has begun. And you too can make this leap and plunge with the alternative movement into the truth that denounces lies and by switching to the light that expels and expose the dark and hidden matters.Finally, friends, be not afraid or intimidated by the threats, or the demise of the advocates of socialist ideology trying to steal your land and freedom. Read, Dear Americans, and take your stand. Let freedom reign in the land and in every nation, for it is written: The Lord is the Governor over the nations and he will rule them with a rod and iron. And Jerusalem will be his throne.
Twitter,2021-01-16T22:01:33+00:00,1,No longer feel safe with twitter dictatorship. The extreme censorship is alarming. Left & will not be rejoining

Twitter,2021-01-15T07:45:22+00:00,1,Suck..so bad no human right.. try to silence people to talk about the truth.. try to silence the president in the United state.. biased one side.. not fair.
Twitter,2021-01-15T03:50:21+00:00,1,Europe will be blocking you .. F.U. MF. 🖕🏼
Twitter,2021-01-14T22:59:38+00:00,1,There are better apps and ones tat do not infringe on our free speech. They tend to apply rules to certain groups or people. This is based on who or what they do not agree with...so very bias. Twitter and other main stream social media currently has too much control..period.  There are better apps on the rise...
Twitter,2021-01-14T21:16:24+00:00,1,They really deserve a minus, after stolen free speech. They still have antifa plus more encouraging violence on its platform.  I unregistered plus also Facebook. I watch whats going with high tech and major news stations. I don't watch any one sided news.  Wake up America
Twitter,2021-01-14T13:58:52+00:00,1,It says keep feedback honest, so here we go....This is a terrorist organization that has double standards.  If you American People don't stand now, you will not have an opportunity.  THIS COMPANY STANDS FOR DIVISION, DOUBLE STANDARDS, COMMUNISM, AND HORRIBLE LEFT!
Twitter,2021-01-14T08:01:20+00:00,1,Total crap, I hope everyone gets off this site and Trump starts his own New one!
Twitter,2021-01-14T07:53:34+00:00,1,Twitter is confusing, confusing, confusing! I just feel so stupid on it, and amazed at how people can get so many followers on it.I know lots of people like such sites, but these sites are just like, why do they allow so many profiles that look like human sex trafficking victims that are being vied on for on the site? I think the site is scary. I have a master's in human rights law and I am on the board of a human rights research institute. I know what these kind of profiles look like.
Twitter,2021-01-14T07:12:37+00:00,1,Horrific is all

Horrible site full of lies and hatred will never us and everyone i know wont either and are currently shutting theirs down... go cry in the corner, you guys f&$ked up!!! Period!!!!! We dont need you anymore 😘👋🏼
Twitter,2021-01-13T04:14:56+00:00,1,Our company wasted SO much money on this platform. . . not only was it useless and had no return, the CEO idiot Jack Dorsey became so obsessed with turning his company into a liberal political platform that censors and silences innocent voices in overt acts of ideological racism.  If violates at least the PRINCIPLES of Free Speech inherent in pretending to be a public square/platform, and at most the trust of its users with unfettered and indiscriminate removal of content on vague and unequally applied policies.  We will be moving our business elsewhere and investing our advertising dollars in platforms that do not discriminate, are not racist on the base of skin color OR party color.  We are intolerant of intolerance.
Twitter,2021-01-13T02:32:38+00:00,1,Twitter's double standard of silencing conservative voices and then being appalled when Uganda blocks social media and messaging apps prior to their election shows exactly how hypocritical they are.   They want to censor those they don't agree with, but can't deal with anyone that may do the same to them.
Twitter,2021-01-13T01:32:05+00:00,1,Closed the others account without notify them, so bad
Twitter,2021-01-13T01:17:13+00:00,1,You can't trust these communists with your information.  Imagine what they are doing behind the scenes with your personal information if this is what they do in clear sight.  Take this company down.
Twitter,2021-01-13T01:04:05+00:00,1,Same as facebook....No free speech allowed. One way narrative... I deleted my account. You should do the same. One day they will censure you.
Twitter,2021-01-13T00:40:20+00:00,1,Not only does Twitter have a stupid name it has unfair and detestable practises. Elated to know that Twit along with Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple just dug their own graves by predictably and disgustingly over playing their hand.
Twitter,2021-01-13T00:13:09+00:00,1,I suspended my twitter account as soon as I realized that conservative voices were being banned and blacklisted by likeminded tech companies and organizations. This is still the United States of America and we all have the right to voice our opinions, this is not the USSR or Communist China. Silencing any person or group of people is a dangerous idea. It will backfire on anti-American Twitter. Twitter should be revoked from having Section 230 status!
Twitter,2021-01-13T00:09:02+00:00,1,Twitter is a communist platform. They do not allow free speech. They are trying to tear our country apart, and they are trying to silence everyone who doesn’t think the way that they do.#boycotttwitter
Twitter,2021-01-12T23:59:40+00:00,1,You are bias with information you allow. You discriminate against conservative views. When you turn off the President’s account you are turning of off for every American. People are no longer alllowed to hear the truth from social media platforms and news.
Twitter,2021-01-12T22:49:02+00:00,1,When you don’t have enough respect for freedom of speech you don’t deserve to be in business just deleted the app!!! I think the world should follow
Twitter,2021-01-12T20:28:04+00:00,1,You are a contradiction as a whole.. If your goal was to let people have open forum with discussion, debate and freedom of speech then you have failed.Who wants a one sided forum anyways..One sided dialogue...
Twitter,2021-01-12T19:21:43+00:00,1,We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
Twitter,2021-01-12T19:14:35+00:00,1,Dear Twitter, Stop censoring people on your platform! We value free speech! even if you disagree with the person!
Twitter,2021-01-12T18:54:46+00:00,1,This platform has turned itself into a publisher and as such now feels it can judge whose speech should be allowed.  It is untrustworthy and part of a tech takeover of the US.  I closed my account after they began purging those they don't agree with.
Twitter,2021-01-12T17:49:31+00:00,1,When Twitter limits your account @ottisb for no apparent reason and they don’t send you a verification text message or a call why exactly are you meant to do?  Case raises however no response it’s been over 3 weeks now.  Possibly one of the worst companies ‘Ever.  You can no longer speak your mind.

Twitter,2021-01-12T16:14:02+00:00,1,Deleted my Twitter along with Amazon. Will not support anyone who tries taking away free speech.

Twitter,2021-01-12T15:03:16+00:00,1,This company suffers from extreme hypocrisy. If you agree with their politics you may enjoy it, basically just a giant echo chamber. If you do not, you will be banned. Don't put anything on there you aren't willing to lose at a moments notice.
Twitter,2021-01-12T14:59:52+00:00,1,Wish I could rate 0 stars. I sold my stock shares in this company. I thought companies were supposed to want freedoms. I informed my stock broker and their advertisers I wont be doing business with any of them

Twitter’s decision to pick and choose what “free-speech” is allowed and to block information they disagree with is dangerously divisive and destructive . This country (democratic republic) is built on the difference of opinion with discussion and compromise (We The People)... not heavy-handed fascism, they are contributing to the erosion of America... who will be canceled next?!?!"

How dare you block the president of the United States because he doesn’t support your crazy ass sick corruption. Hope he brings down big tech and deep state criminals. Maybe if he were a pedophile it would be different? No censorship? Who are you to ban freedom of speech? Little tweety tw*t bird Twitter.
Twitter,2021-01-12T04:19:10+00:00,1,Dictator company!! Censoring people and the President of USA. Freedom of speech means both way. Deletes along side Facebook, Amazon, whatsapp etc.I wouldn't wish you luck. Happy to see the downfall.
Twitter,2021-01-12T04:14:21+00:00,1,Closed my accounts. Not going to use a service that suppresses free speech.
Twitter,2021-01-12T04:00:19+00:00,1,Best wishes in your financial downfall. I’m sure you’ll probably censor my review too.
Twitter,2021-01-12T03:48:03+00:00,1,They are control freaks who ban anyone who doesn't say what they want them to. A communist company. They need to move to China where they fit in to the culture because here in America this is NOT ok.

Twitter,2021-01-12T00:44:48+00:00,1,Dumped my account, you have no right setting up this platform and deciding upon yourself what is posted that goes against your “standards”. If these so called standards are straight across the board then others would have been suspended a long time ago. You can’t silence us!
Twitter,2021-01-11T23:39:56+00:00,1,I don't have a Twitter account, but if I did, I wouldn't.
Twitter,2021-01-11T22:55:35+00:00,1,Your company has shown their true communist colors.  I will no longer be using your communist propaganda platform.   You are an unamerican company that I will not do business with.  Live free or die!

Twitter,2021-01-11T20:08:27+00:00,1,Censorship is for China.  Not for America. You suck twitter.  I do not recommend.  Two thumbs down.  Horrible
Twitter,2021-01-11T20:05:36+00:00,1,Censorship of people that don’t have the same views should be illegal. It should fall under discrimination to block and delete people just because of their political affiliation. 0 stars. Horrible app.
Twitter,2021-01-11T20:01:44+00:00,1,I stand for my president. I stand for my rights. I have the freedom to speak what I want , when I want!! This app is horrible and will not shut me down. It’s the most lowercase application in the App Store. Do not get Twitter! Shame on them! Shame on it! Jesus lives, God will do what is best.
Twitter,2021-01-11T19:39:12+00:00,1,I am giving them a 1 star because i can't give them a 0 star, My problem with Twitter is the ceo is a jerk and thinks he runs the usa, he uses his power to control the republican party , he also runs companies out of business that do not align with his belief's. I have delete them and their application and dont be fooled if they see something they do not like you are automatically blocked for posting or commenting, you do not have anyway to talk to them or to work it out or disagree with them. This company is here to control your life, do your self a favor and buy a house phone and call your family because you have a opinion and it doesn't align with facebook the liberal can say whatever they want to you attack you threaten you but nothing is done to them only you. But above all they ruin anyone that is competition to them. BEAWARE DO NOT LET THEM RUIN YOUR LIFE.
Twitter,2021-01-11T18:55:39+00:00,1,Censorship because an individuals beliefs do not line up with your own is never acceptable. If you find this to be ok just wait until they don’t like what you have to say next.
Twitter,2021-01-11T18:47:23+00:00,1,Deleted my twitter account next on list is whatsapp...
Twitter,2021-01-11T18:39:13+00:00,1,Deactivated my account as soon as they exposed their true colors.  I stand for free speech.
Twitter,2021-01-11T18:34:14+00:00,1,To ban someone or what they say that does not align with your thoughts, feelings or beliefs is wrong on multiple levels. Just because you don't agree with what someone posts or that individual does not mean that everyone else does not agree. It has quickly become transparent what Twitter is about and their alignment with the corrupt censorship. You have lost the support of 1 who will soon be counted among many. I hope the consequence of your actions and decisions will teach the people who instigated them valuable lessons.
Twitter,2021-01-11T18:17:50+00:00,1,I never thought I would see the day that an American company would have the audacity to block The President of the United States. Censorship is just plain wrong. You may not agree with what a person says but in this country until now you had the right to speak freely without fear . Now anyone that has an opinion that doesn’t sit right with a liberal ideology has to worry that they will be persecuted for their beliefs. The tolerant left is only tolerant so long as you believe as they do. If this doesn’t stop companies like Twitter and Facebook will be responsible for even more madness.
Twitter,2021-01-11T17:47:01+00:00,1,Pathetic. The only thing they will let you post is what they want you to post. Stupid left winged site. If you love your freedom and are not a puppet. Then I recommend deleting your account with them.
Twitter,2021-01-11T17:16:27+00:00,1,Underage kids can talk about how good their “WAP” is but the moment I express my feelings about politics I get banned. Worst social media platform ever!!
Twitter,2021-01-11T17:16:05+00:00,1,Twitter is right up there with communist Facebook! They censor everyone and anyone, including POTUS, if you even dare to have a different opinion than what their political agenda is. I have deleted my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. I lived before these Commie social media apps existed, and I will live after them as well! Bye felicia!
Twitter,2021-01-11T16:42:19+00:00,1,If you want an app that makes you feel you're living in 1930's Nazi Germany! Well you've come to the right place. You too can incite violence, put out calls to silence peoples voices, ruin small business with just a tweet. What more could you ask for! Hurry and join today!

Twitter,2021-01-11T11:16:44+00:00,1,Twitter is trying to silence Americans. It is a biased company. They may be trying to silence conservative voices but it’s not working and I have personally never heard conservatives be so loud about their thoughts, opinions, and out right facts that companies like Twitter are trying to keep secret.

Twitter,2021-01-10T21:34:06+00:00,1,This platform is very dangerous it censors things that is incorrect in its own opinion.

Twitter,2021-01-10T14:13:47+00:00,1,Twitter banning of the president is ridiculous. Banning free speech. Who do they think they are? They shadow banned me for tweeting about Hunter Biden and Raphael Warnock. And my tweets weren't hate speech or trying to incite violence.  They were the truth.Twitter is suppressing the truth about the left when conservatives are trying to get it out.

Twitter,2021-01-10T06:32:43+00:00,1,Twitter is fine if you don't mind kowtowing to their viewpoint. If you have a Conservative viewpoint you will be shadow banned and eventually suspended. Twitter does not like free thinkers. They have tossed the 1st Amendment in the garbage, but that is exactly where this app belongs..
Twitter,2021-01-10T06:15:45+00:00,1,Twitter is a cesspool, ask yourself if any successful person has time to spend all day on twitter ranting and arguing with others? Save yourself and your time from these negative experiences! Go outside, enjoy the fresh air with your family and friends.

Twitter,2021-01-09T19:39:42+00:00,1,Twitter is offensive and towards specific people because of their beliefs and what they stand for. Why they think this is ok is sickening. Censoring people just because you don’t like them is not right. They will go down with the rest of the leftists that think they will rule the American people. The American people are fed up and will not tolerate this behavior from anyone. I would not recommend this platform. Use Parler instead .

Twitter,2021-01-07T22:14:59+00:00,1,They only allow one side to vent their frustrations.  This is what helps spread division and hate.  Either neither side is allowed to spread their hate and violence or you need to stop censoring.
Twitter,2021-01-07T15:53:03+00:00,1,Too much liberal censorship, no free speech. Discrimination on political views. Zero integrity in this company. Wouldn’t use ever!
Twitter,2021-01-07T01:43:57+00:00,1,Twitter has gone way off the deep end. Locking the President of the United States out of his account after he calls for peace is unacceptable. It is clear that they do not want the message of peace, law, and order to reach the American people. This company is a disgrace to America.
Twitter,2021-01-07T01:07:54+00:00,1,I have never been this bore as to what Twitter has done to my Twitter account. Whenever I try to post a tweet either written, photo or whatever what I keep seeing is "Failed to send tweet". I change the password and also reinstalled the app yet nothing change. Please I need help.
Twitter,2021-01-07T00:38:25+00:00,1,AVOID. DON'T BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH AND DON'T SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION. DISGUSTING COMPANY.
Twitter,2021-01-07T00:08:35+00:00,1,I'd give Twitter no stars at all. They are a bunch of hypocrites with communist tendencies.  They are censoring everyone with political view other than their own.  They will suspend your account and won't give you a chance to support your own case for the suspension.  They act like they own the internet and all political views.  I call them out for being communists under the Biden administration.  I would never open account with these keyboard thugs. Find out for yourself!

Twitter,2021-01-01T13:21:38+00:00,1,Twitter most over policed, unfair platform my account was suspended I do not know why after I complained to them about someone harassing me. Unbelievable there is no redress they do not even speak with you or ask for any explanation. I have appealed 3 times all the response I receive was a automated emails keep telling me to appeal. Still nothing yet they allow people such a trump to sit there and say the most untrue things. Jack Dorsey one of the CEO I have also emailed and wait for a response to explain why twitter acts in such a fashion. I do not know any other social media platform that suspends, dissolves, removes account like sweets such as twitter. Come on if it was not for your customers twitter would not survive maybe it's time people think about maybe replacing this over policed platform not policing in the right way. It needs a over haul. I want this to be resolved fairly as this should never have happened it seems the CEO'S do not care about it's customers only penalising them wrongly half the time. Maybe it's time someone invented a new platform away from twitter.
Twitter,2020-12-31T11:06:28+00:00,1,Twitter is easily the far worst social media ever next to Facebook. It is pointless and what is the concept of Twitter with limited of messages? Facebook has all that plus even more. Parler is better option than Twitter when it comes to free speech. Both Twitter and Facebook is garbage due to ridiculous censorship that is going on these days. Stay away from both of them. Trustpilot also do censor comments. Why am I not surprised with any of this?
Twitter,2020-12-29T23:35:53+00:00,1,Twitter kicked me off for disagreeing with Donald Trump. Message received twitter thanks from a disabled vet.
Twitter,2020-12-29T16:00:49+00:00,1,My account was locked on October 6th, 2020 for 'hateful conduct'.  I have not violated their rules as I understand them.  I have been trying for almost 3 months to get my account unlocked but my emails generally are ignored.  There is no one accountable at Twitter and their suspensions seem random and biased towards right wing accounts. Since 30 days have lapsed, Twitter has removed my historical content.  I repeat.  There is no person, link or phone number provided by Twitter to voice a complain to. When I worked in IT, we had logs and data trails to review processes historically.  Twitter has billions in revenue so they can afford to take responsibility for their actions.I want my account unlocked, my history restored and want Twitter to be held accountable when their algorithms flag accounts for suspension randomly.  No one should have an indefinite suspension of their Twitter account without cause.  I have also issued a complaint about Twitter to the FTC.
Twitter,2020-12-29T03:20:02+00:00,2,Love twitter it's super fun however you can get suspended and accused of violating twitter rules when you literally haven't done anything wrong and then when someone harassed YOU on there and you have evidence and twitter support say the person didn't violate their rules..In 2015 I had a guy harass me on there for blocking him. He then proceeded to make new accounts (each time admitting it was him) and he even DM'D me on twitter saying he'd keep making accounts just to harass me on there. I reported him and provided the evidence and they said he wasnt violating their rules!Different situation that's unrelated. I retweeted a video that I related to. Just a stand up comedy that featured Ricky Gervais. Put a caption that didn't mention names saying I had the same thing happen to me (as what Ricky was explaining in the video) next thing you know I get suspended because Twitter decided the retweet "violated their rules" supposedly something to do with hate speech, racism, harassing..Huh?? No names were mentioned, it wasnt threatening and it was no worse than I've seen on twitter many MANY times before. YET they suspended my account because of the retweet. They didn't see me being harassed in 2015 as a violation even when the guy admitted it in a message that I sent Twitter but a RETWEET that agreed to a point made by a comedian THAT was a suspend worthy violation? Riiight...also I've seen PORN on Twitter and I've seen people spread hate about MANY people and not get suspended. Mine was agreeing to a hilarious and very true stand up comedy about those scumbags who take random posts personal when the person posting doesn't even know them so it could be about anyone. I was agreeing to that cause it happened to me. Twitter suspended me and took down the tweet and threatened to take some my account.Twitter support are obviously morons if they don't actually know what threatening, hate speech, racism and harassment is and SELECTIVELY suspend you for literally no reason. They're absolutely disgraceful and should be ashamed of themselves.As for twitter itself I enjoy it a lot. I do wish there was an edit option on our tweets though and I wish we could write more (very little space to write) some argue they prefer it like that.P.S If they do take down my account i'll just rejoin and continue retweeting as apparently making multiple accounts isn't a violation according to you circa 2015 so...👍
Twitter,2020-12-28T08:02:30+00:00,1,I used to love her, but... the censorship algorithms went crazy. Whoever these independant fact checkers are who ban family photos, and endearing praises to my own children are beyond the point of Socialist Dictators. I was banned for posting a picture of my daughter and myself, and saying how proud I was of my daughter for serving our country, as part of the first all female infantry unit in Afganistan. Twitter found my fatherly pride to be too much to share on their platform. When it becomes illegal to post baby pictures, I will know Nazi Germany has taken over the Liberal platforms.

Twitter,2020-12-23T04:53:35+00:00,4,sorry but I love this website. It's my favourite social media. It's full of a lot of smart people like journalists who have interesting things to say in bite-sized pieces (tweets). Lots of funny and amusing things too. I've learnt a lot and been hugely entertained over the years. It isn't the kind of brain-rotting social media that makes you feel bad looking at people showcasing that they have a great life.Not giving it 5 stars because in some cases I wish it was easier or more private to use e.g. I'd like to follow a bunch of people without them knowing.But if you like to use your brain and enjoy news/politics/social issues, this is the social media to use.

Twitter,2020-12-13T23:37:21+00:00,1,The reason for my rate is I use to like using twitter until they suspended my account @KevinTerribly back in March by mistake because it was hacked from an iphone posting things I was having to delete myself that person was posting while I wasn't using twitter at the time then they were doing other things I didn't know about plus I've been filling out the support form for something that shouldn't have happened in the first place since my account was suspended because of that person who hacked my account I can log into still. On the other hand never got back to me on my new twitter account through support either but never got an e-mail back from them for help with my issue and they could fix this.
Twitter,2020-12-13T01:00:00+00:00,1,Censorship and Oppression, that sums it up. Never give up!! Right will win.
Twitter,2020-12-12T16:47:10+00:00,4,Twitter is one of the leading social media platforms in the world, and I see why; it's informative, full of content, active and widely available therefore the community is huge meaning there is always someone to interact with.The navigation around the site isn't as self explanatory as some others, this may be as it is very full, whereas other websites stick to a more simple dashboard.Also sometimes I find it hard to find content I am looking for as there is so much it's hard to filter for what you're really looking for.Another thing to bear in mind is that every post you like, comment or retweet will show up on your profile page, this can be a negative aspect of the site to some.Overall Twitter has many benefits, hence it's tremendous success, it can seem overwhelming to beginners however you will get used to it if you spend time getting to know it.

Go over to Gab or Parlour or MeWe.

Twitter,2020-11-29T20:35:09+00:00,1,Since the US government cannot constitutionally censor dissidents thanks to the Bill of Rights, they do so through "private" corporations like Twitter. Over the years, I have collected numerous screenshots of Twitter censorship in action and a company blacklist was even discovered by hackers. Look it up.Whether you criticize illegals wars, occupations, war criminals, make jokes, expose war crimes, or even create parodies of criminals like Jeffrey Epstein, the Twitter team will be there to censor you on the spot using various methods whether banning a search of your name, hiding your replies, or simply deleting your account without any warning or explanations. Twitter also collects phone numbers to blacklist people so if you try signing up again, you will find yourself automatically blacklisted.Basically if you don't go along with whatever the government does, especially foreign policy, you'll find Twitter putting up walls all around you to put you in your own echo chamber and eventually purging you.

Twitter,2020-11-29T00:24:34+00:00,1,The limitation of 280 characters makes the website just a ton of pointless informational garbage. Since retweets are the only way how posts get viral, the majority of popular tweets are always something emotional or something that teaches you "who is bad and who is good". Simply tweets get viral when many tweeter users live in the same imaginary world. Don't waste your time, avoid the website, you will lose absolutely nothing.

Twitter,2020-11-26T09:31:56+00:00,1,I have been using Twitter for personal use for quite a few years and have been rather dis-satisfied with the "service".When a "service" is unreliable, cannot be sorted out when things go wrong, and when Support staff are totally unreachable - it is not a "service" it is a hindrance.I WOULD NEVER USE TWITTER FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES – IT IS TOO UNRELIABLE.I have several personal accounts and for the past week I have been unable to Tweet.This has occurred several times now.When I send a Tweet, I see the message "Your Tweet was sent" - but in fact it hasn't. The Tweet appears on my Timeline - but does not appear on the destination Timeline.VERY DECEIVING.I know that the Tweet has NOT been sent because I am able to check using another account.It seems that quite often I find my accounts have been severely restricted rendering them unusable.And what is worse, I discover that my more recent Tweets have been deleted.I am not aware of any reason why my accounts have been restricted.I am not given a reason by Twitter why they have been restricted.I don't even know if they have been deliberately restricted by Twitter or if it is a system bug.If you want evidence of my claim, just look at more of these reviews on Trustpilot, even better, look at the “@Twittersupport” page on Twitter itself.Finally I repeat, don’t rely on Twitter for a Business.

Take it from someone who was on Twitter, until I voluntarily deleted my account - I immediately felt 60% better about myself. Stay away from this seeping boil on the internet - open a Parler account instead. You'll be glad you did.

Twitter,2020-11-21T21:37:52+00:00,1,Not a free speech zone. Twitter censors your tweets if you do not agree with twitters political views. I have deregistered my account with twitter and moved to Parler who supports free speech.

Twitter,2020-11-20T06:19:12+00:00,1,Twitter is the worst company, who ever said they are a great company is because they are butt kissers. Twitter sensor all types of wording, even when it is harmless to another. You don't have any freedom of speech at all. It is a disgrace to the American people, and Twitter is a company who sole purpose is to freeze or lock accounts that have NOT violated any rules, or regulations of any kind. It is uncalled for, that they only will allow content they only agree on. If it is not what they believe to be true, they will lock up your account. The same goes for facebook. It is a dictatorship of a company, that shows no bias of what is true or lies. They allow brain washing of there users to stay on, while freezing of accounts who speak the truth. Go ahead Twitter keep it up, and eventually thoes who see the lies will leave you as well. My paranormal team will not be back. I would rather pass out fliers door to door to get my audience, then ever go back to you. You couldn't pay me money to come back! Don't try to sweet talk me, to come back.

I don't have access to the email address I used when I created the Twitter account, and I keep getting the same response to my request "Hello,The email address you used to reach out doesn’t match the email on the account you mentioned.You can file a new request using the email address already associated with the account if the email on the first request was a mistake."I already told them the emails didn't match. The fact that they don't have some method to reset the account when you lose access is kind of like being DOS in the Windows world.I only want to close my account, and check every few months or every year, to see if they caught up with technology.Nope! Not yet.I'm glad I'm not an avid user.
Twitter,2020-11-06T00:38:50+00:00,1,Biden  & Liberal loving freaks. Censors posts that don’t line up with their Democratic views, so disgusting. Having this app is equivalent to hanging around miserable, purple-haired teens swearing at the world and swearing at anything or anyone that asks for hard work.
Twitter,2020-11-03T09:12:43+00:00,1,This is my second review of Twitter, and the service has deteriorated still further. Now, Twitter have resorted to petty, childish, behaviour. They are clearly a weak company, who cannot behave maturely, or deal with criticism. The company lacks the skills to reply to individuals, and will send the standard, cut and paste, 'sorry you feel that way' brush off.
Twitter,2020-11-02T17:31:03+00:00,1,Censorship and bias On an exponential level
Twitter,2020-11-02T14:41:35+00:00,1,Wish I could give a negative 5 stars review. They are biased as hell and suspended an 11 year old account with 90k followers for no reason 2 weeks before election.  They refuse to give a reason or answer my emails. They won't even answer the BBB complaints.
Twitter,2020-11-02T03:46:03+00:00,1,Twitter censors everybody that they do not agree with. 1st Amendment? No. Not with Twitter.
Twitter,2020-11-01T14:05:24+00:00,1,Twitter applies its rules unevenly, unfairly, and capriciously.  It has only online support operated by kindergarten schoolboys.  It suspended one account, locked two others, never explained why, specifically, sent online suggestions with no relation to my problem, closed each case without ever addressing the problem, and, when I continued requesting help, reduced the app to a blank page.  No recourse. So many reviews over last 3 years day similar things.  So  support never improves its approach
Twitter,2020-10-31T14:36:00+00:00,1,I have requested to twitter several time for restoring my account  @rpsndey362But have not received any reply from twitter teamUser Name-Rupesh Pandey
Twitter,2020-10-31T03:29:08+00:00,1,In the same day that a 70-year old lady was decapitated, a man's throat slit and another woman stabbed to death inside a church in France, by an Islamic terrorist, "Islamaphobia" was instantly trending. This site cares more about people's feelings than people's lives.
Twitter,2020-10-30T10:59:16+00:00,1,Ban twitter not a fare Company.  No freedom of speech.  Too far left.  Pushing to remove Section 230 then see what happens to them.  I deactivated my account will not use or promote them.  Twitter sucks.  If we all ban them they will only have left Dems left no news.
Twitter,2020-10-29T19:57:40+00:00,1,Suspended my account for no reason, customer service wouldn't even reply. Yet they let Trump tweet racist bullying threats daily. I hate their double standards. Horrible service. #boycotttwitter
Twitter,2020-10-29T18:23:52+00:00,1,Twitter sucks. Haven't been there long. I been censored like everyday I get out of twitter jail. Free speech right to peacefully assemble. Unconstitutional. Blocking free speech is election meddling. Should be sued or shut down. Hope twitter falls off the earth and jack loses all his $$ from being sued. Facebook is better then Twitter and that sad.
Twitter,2020-10-29T09:48:15+00:00,2,There are very few reasons for Twitter to suspend the account, and the censorship process is slow.
Twitter,2020-10-28T22:40:22+00:00,1,I deleted the app after a Facebook friend spoke of their censoring people.   I posted a comment saying " No one will put up with bullying censorship " .  THEY LOCKED MY ACCT.  I GUESS MY FRIEND WAS RIGHT.  BOTH OF US ARE CONSERVATIVES.
Twitter,2020-10-28T11:39:51+00:00,1,Twitter is one of the most anti-American platforms in existence. They suspended my account without providing any reasoning. I'm sure its simply because my views don't line up with theirs. We should be allowed to speak freely, unless threatening harm to others.
Twitter,2020-10-27T22:49:00+00:00,1,I had been a user for many years.  Used for sports, politics, religion, research, business, etc.  The hardcore left leaning bias/hatred is palpable, but I dealt with it.  But I just received an account suspension for totally innocuous reply to someone's tweet.  That was it, no need to appeal.....I'm moving to Parler where other feedback suggests they protect and encourage free speech.
Twitter,2020-10-27T17:06:24+00:00,1,A video was sent using my account , of which the sentiment I totally agree with, i got suspended, and now I can’t even get rid of the account and if it gets unsuspended i still don’t want it or notifications from twitter , you get strangers following you for no reason which i find creepy and it’s really dead and extremely boring
Twitter,2020-10-27T04:14:27+00:00,1,If I could give them zero stars I would you have no freedom of speech they shut your voice down for speaking the truth
Twitter,2020-10-26T20:56:39+00:00,1,Sad how twiitter is silencing the American people about political policies. Twiitter instead has taken a stance to promote a one sided agenda. Its nasty and unfair, for companies to come into power, because of the people of this country, and silence Americans! Lawsuits are coming!!!!!!
Twitter,2020-10-26T17:57:51+00:00,1,My partner has an account set up for his business that has been locked, and despite typing the password and email in correctly there is no way to access his account, leaving him unable to respond to clients or promote anything. He has contacted Twitter numerous times to no avail, all we receive are automated replies. Good luck accessing your account if this happens to you as it seems to be quite common and twitter leave you high and dry with no explanation! We are moving the business onto a more reliable social media platform from now on.
Twitter,2020-10-25T16:29:11+00:00,1,This site will let Donald Trump AND his supporters say anything and post anything on Twitter but as soon as you respond to defend the people they're talking about they'll suspend you instead of the racist people who started saying stuff UNBELIEVABLE! SMFH!
Twitter,2020-10-23T11:43:00+00:00,1,Will ban you for showing evidence of abuse.
Twitter,2020-10-21T21:26:28+00:00,2,I started using Twitter because of a website I use.  I get an email telling of a new post.  About 3 weeks ago I got the email and bit had p orn on it.   I did not request it, and don't know how to get it off the email t witter sends me.  Very disappointed that t witter would even send this kind of thing out.
Twitter,2020-10-21T10:03:18+00:00,1,They lock you out your account for no damn reason. They say they can't verify my account which is a lie. Twitter  is nothing but a misinformation social media site anyway. They told me to open a new account but I pass.
Twitter,2020-10-19T13:56:28+00:00,5,This is a very good starter app:)))))Love it!
Twitter,2020-10-17T05:07:26+00:00,1,For Twitter to limit what people can see and say. It's obvious that they are democratic based. Freedom of the press has definitely left America and Twitter has shown they can be bought at a price.    The decision they made  appears to be the first step that we going to start becoming like China where the government can with hold people from speaking their mind and that's very sad if that's where this is going. One has to wonder who is behind this at Twitter what foreign country or sadly the Democrat party.
Twitter,2020-10-17T01:11:08+00:00,1,-10 is what I really want to give this company! I would never use Twitter and hope others will cut them off and quit using them at least until they stop this nonsense!! For a social media company to decide what users can share and what they can't, that is the most socialist crap I have ever seen in America! They are clearly politically biased and give the democrats all kinds of money. Why? So they can get by with controlling what we can see, read and share. That is what socialism is and that is ridiculous that the company can even do that! I applaud the Senate committee for bringing them in to explain this. When a social media company lets all kinds of untrue and confidential information go around on it's site about the President and others and then block a democratic candidate for President, you can get any clearer than that about what is going on. They are obviously pushing for a socialist country and are already acting like we are one by what they did. Folks, just look at the socialists countries and see how bad off they are!
Twitter,2020-10-16T23:23:10+00:00,1,I beg all Republicans to close all Twitter and FB accounts.  They have censored our  Freedom of Speech regarding Hunter Biden and good old dad emails!  Time to make a stand.  The “silent majority” will no longer stand  for liberal media and their lies!!!!!  Pass it on!!!! Freedoms more important than social media!!!
Twitter,2020-10-16T06:44:55+00:00,1,Horrendous experience of platform with almost zero ethics/accountability for misinformation, cyber bullying, and online harassment. Major service outtages on website more than 8hrs now.
Twitter,2020-10-15T15:22:20+00:00,1,Its a biased political platform that caters to dummycrats  and libtards ..very terrible site indeed , unless you fondle their nuts
Twitter,2020-10-13T22:31:06+00:00,1,With so many fake accounts, who can believe ANYTHING on this scamming site? AND they have NO customer service email OR phone number. Sound like some other scamming platforms? Hell, yes. YouTube, Google, Facebook, Brand New Tube, NewTube. app, etc. Is it any wonder these platforms are under investigation by the Judiciary Committee?? BTW, don't even go to a home page for these corrupt scammers....they'll steal your info.
Twitter,2020-10-12T11:38:03+00:00,4,Pros Using Twitter over the years has been a very wonderful experience for me. the user experience is great, the layout is cool and superb updates keep rolling in. Twitter is best platform to read news and people’s opinions.
Twitter,2020-10-10T20:01:15+00:00,1,Twitter has been the worst experience of my life. I have witnessed: child abuse videos, pornography, violent videos, death threats, animal abuse, political propaganda, received insidious abuse and reported everything to Twitter. I tweeted a quote from Sophie Duker and had my account suspended for breaking the rules, even though twitter allowed the original video to be played. Evil, vile, insidious, unregulated human depravity.
Twitter,2020-10-10T17:57:06+00:00,1,Like a window into a very disturbed fantasy world. People who use this thing can't really be taken seriously in society moving towards 2021. Micro-blogging, manufactured trends nonsense.
Twitter,2020-10-10T15:50:46+00:00,5,It has been very good, and some areas need improvement.
Twitter,2020-10-09T21:44:12+00:00,2,Needs better verification to stop people hiding behind their phones to cite abuse
Twitter,2020-10-09T19:33:33+00:00,1,Twitter allows Trump to attack people and put out dangerous false information that his followers believe and even has caused violence throughout the country. So in my opinion Twitter should be shut down let Americans heal from the hateful attacks!!
Twitter,2020-10-07T15:38:19+00:00,1,I ❤️ Twitter as a platform, but there doesn’t seem to be any support. Literally nothing. Had my account 10 years, verified blue tick, 41k followers. Never in trouble. But my account was locked last week due to “suspicious activity” 🤷‍♀️ Have sent Twitter well over 30 emails this week requesting help - only get automated replies back. Stuck in a loop. No means of human contact. Very poor considering I love the site and have done nothing wrong. Breaks my heart. All the other platforms have a means of contact, but you can see from reviews across the internet how bad Twitter are on this front. Real shame. Really hope I get the account I’ve built up over the years back, but I’ve tried everything I can 🤷‍♀️
Twitter,2020-10-07T10:27:38+00:00,5,Twitter gives me up-to-date news around the world from sports to politics. I love it!
Twitter,2020-10-07T01:58:05+00:00,1,Zero customer service have reported a problem with my account for 5 weeks now and no one as come back to my 100 e mails
Twitter,2020-10-03T15:08:18+00:00,1,This platform is evil. Users are either ignorant or complicit in the reasons why. If you don't know what I'm talking about then you really shouldn't be on twitter. If you support twitter you support authiritism and the idea that people are too stupid to think for themselves and must have the correct opinions given to them.
Twitter,2020-10-02T10:10:26+00:00,4,Good avenue to connect with friends and family who are away due to the global pandemic.  Even the famous people  I follow shares whatever is on their mind. :)
Twitter,2020-10-02T01:47:39+00:00,1,Actually half a star but I am disappointed.  I have had Twitter for years and was flagged for “violence” because I said I would’ve taken a penalty in a football game.  Thanks Twitter for doing that, you clearly have a pulse on everyone
Twitter,2020-10-01T08:47:21+00:00,1,Logged into my personal account last week (11 year old account, 1200+ followers), was told it was locked due to "suspicious activity" and I needed to verify my phone number. Every time I did that it said "verification request failed". Have tried nearly every support channel and sent about 20 support requests over the space of a week. Did not get any response. Account has been locked for almost a week.The experience has been so bad, my business has  decided to stop advertising on Twitter at the end of October. We didn't spend a huge amount, maybe $4000 a year, but we will now be spending that on a different platform.
Twitter,2020-09-29T23:01:27+00:00,1,Twitter spell check changed my word shoost to shoot then suspended me for it! They said I could appeal it which I did. My account sat in limbo for over a week and the did nothing. So I deactivated my account and switched to Parler!
Twitter,2020-09-27T09:07:15+00:00,1,My biggest problem is the lack of user supportCompanies that guard themselves from their end-users poses are a ethical real issue to me.Why set-up a platform, then refuse to engage with it's users? Surely this goes against what the business stands for? Communication?Where it really hurts is if you have a technical problem... literally no one to get help from, you just get automated message pushing you to poorly written generic FAQ pages – which never quite solve the problem.
Twitter,2020-09-26T14:58:09+00:00,1,Twitter everyone can say what thay like but soon as you say something back thay ban you its rubbish all snowflakes on there .
Twitter,2020-09-24T16:28:47+00:00,1,Over 3 months of waiting, every option in their 'support' centre tried and repeated emails left unanswered by anything but a bot.Tried logging in one afternoon and found my account was locked for suspicious activity and required me to change my password, "okay" I thought, no problem, following the process to reset with the phone number I'd set up the account with wasn't possible according to Twitter because the phone number was linked to more than one account, it must be on an account that isn't mine because I've never used it elsewhere and have possessed the number for about 8 years.Unable to use an email address to reset the password either because there isn't one on there, I used the damn phone number to set it up.TLDR: Twitter locked my account requiring a reset with no methods available and never responded to requests for help.
Twitter,2020-09-24T08:30:37+00:00,1,Not impressed.   Twitter is extremely strict with what you can say.  There's no free speech and they interfere with your conversations between other grown adults.They threatened me once and now have locked my account over a disagreement with someone so I got rid of the app.  But I'm unable to delete my account!   Nice, eh?  I guess they want my account, just as long as I can't use it.  That's ok, I have no intention of ever using them again.  No tolerance for games.
Twitter,2020-09-24T06:36:44+00:00,1,Awful. They just block and suspend your account without any warning and then don't justify it. I really wouldn't bother with this crappy platform.
Twitter,2020-09-24T00:15:58+00:00,1,An old lady Amanda Henn has made so many Trump videos to him and his supporters. One was hoping he would die in front of us his supporters. I had enough of this and typed and told this lady off. Asking her how would you like it if we wished your old miserable ass dead. I loose my account for free speech. So that’s fine lost all my followers and people I was following. I’m not one to kiss ass or knee to Twitter I went on there to deactivate my account and they will not allow me to do that. I keep getting a pop up saying something went wrong try again later. I’m a Trump supporter and always will be. So you ass holes at Twitter see this I WANT TO DEACTIVATE MY ACCOUNT. NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR RACIST SITE. Schul47
Twitter,2020-09-23T15:54:59+00:00,1,They hate factual information. They like the majority of the users live in some sort of alternate reality where up is down left is right etc.  The users are dangerously dumb witted. for e.g if you make the most obvious fake fake troll account they automatically assume that it's real and will attack anyone in association with it. They also tend to complain about nonsensical thing's that nobody cares about for e.g the color of bread.
Twitter,2020-09-21T23:07:48+00:00,1,When will these scammers go to jail?They extort confidential information from you by threatening to block your account.And do so!I do not want to give YOU my phone number!They hide behind the fact that you are probably a robot - they dont even try to check it out! All they do - only bloking your account demanding your phone number!They are real criminals!They never respond on complaints from users on the same issues on @supporttwitterThey didnt even let me leave my troubleshooting there - instead blocked my account!
Twitter,2020-09-21T22:40:27+00:00,1,Jack Dorsey need shutting down. Vile platform that picks and chooses what to censor with regard to lining it's pockets.
Twitter,2020-09-20T11:47:40+00:00,4,I love this social media website and application. This is the newspaper of our generation, it has lots of informative information and also entertaining ones, sadly there are still hate posts that are rampant in this platform, but the good actually outweighs the bad.
Twitter,2020-09-17T21:06:16+00:00,1,Run by a group of freedom of speech censoring pedophiles. They should be in prison for violating the constitutional rights of all users.
Twitter,2020-09-17T11:47:50+00:00,1,So, twitter likes to make fun of people( like every pedophile infested and disgusting social media as usual 🙄"Sigh"). Besides that, twitter has no moral standards and people just humiliate each other to the point of suicide. Even I'm feeling sucidial sometimes. Which is why I've deleted my account. This is not the only website that has this problem, but almost every site I've been on is so toxic, I feel really negative.
Twitter,2020-09-17T11:18:41+00:00,1,Banned me for defending myself against right wing extremists.Twitter is fine if you are a right wing individual.
Twitter,2020-09-17T00:35:53+00:00,1,This is the best platform for content but by FAR the worst to get customer support. They will ban your account out of nowhere and after you send twitter support emails they will never reply to you. Try to create a new account and they will ban that one too. Twitter staff including Jack the president are all terrible at their job and down the years they've done nothing to improve the platform which only got worse and worse. I'm forever leaving twitter with a heavy heart because all my friends are there and I used my twitter account to promote my music and now I cant.
Twitter,2020-09-11T08:40:42+00:00,1,Without a reason they block you especially if you are supporting a campaign. Seriously trying to muffle your own platform @twitter
Twitter,2020-09-10T08:33:49+00:00,1,Twitter.com why do you make it impossible to be contacted by phone so a human conversation can take place.Your disgustingly rude and disrespectful.
Twitter,2020-09-09T01:32:00+00:00,1,Keep getting asked for phone number again and again and again because there is something "suspicious" happening with my account. My account seemed to be "automated". They would never reply back via complain form. How the hell do you not have chat option? 18th century still @twitter? Oh, I made BBB complaint and they unlocked my account only to do same thing week later. No longer could you unlock with just email, they wanted....phone number... unless you specifically require phone number to use twitter, stop asking for it...
Twitter,2020-09-08T10:13:33+00:00,1,Very poor, and very xenophobic towards non-Americans. Twitter keep blocking access, for no valid reason. Twitter will just laugh.  They are hell-bent on making it as hard as possible to use the site.
Twitter,2020-09-07T06:45:57+00:00,1,I'm in the process of cleaning everything from my Twitter profile! It is oppressive to have my opinions & freedom of expression scrutinized by Twitter! The website is toxic! I plan to be one of many leaving the site! The right to free speech, & freedom of expression has already been decided by the US Supreme Court! Goodbye Twitter! Just like MySpace & so many other forgotten platforms!
Twitter,2020-09-05T15:52:20+00:00,1,Absolute CessPool of a place.Full of bullies , depressive Trolls and Anti-Semitism.Have had my account suspended twice for nothing more than expressing my conservative opinions in a satirical way on my homepage.Everywhere you turn on their platform you are bombarded with ads supporting and instigating hate groups trying to suck you into their wholly incompetent woke agenda against “Big Bag Wolf , Trumpy”.I would advise any parent to keep your kids away from this vomit inducing parasitic website, where everything unholy And violent is applauded.
Twitter,2020-09-04T03:00:26+00:00,1,This a vessel for the miserable people to spread and encourage hate. This site is designed to enrage you and make terrible people happy at your misery. I have never been so disgusted in the human race until visiting this site
Twitter,2020-09-02T20:34:36+00:00,1,Avoid Twitter like the plague at all costs to keep your mind healthy and to be free from those who mean you harm
Twitter,2020-09-02T19:19:22+00:00,3,Good for keeping up with other teachers, but thats about it
Twitter,2020-09-01T06:41:57+00:00,1,Twitter fail to respond to reports of accounts which are posting naked pictures of young children, young peoples online contact details and encouraging self harm. Many reports for months and nothing is done. Disgusting. They are supporting CHILD ABUSE. They can remove accounts, they have been made aware but do NOTHING. Shameful.
Twitter,2020-08-31T16:06:38+00:00,1,My experience with Twitter is not a good one. I experienced Twitter picking and choosing what would actually post on your site "for other's to see". I posted a critical observation of CBS news. Twitter blocked it. They won't let a citizen criticize "a Liberal media source". This is Russia at the max! Don't let them have your info, that is where they are making money on all of us.
Twitter,2020-08-31T11:42:59+00:00,1,We need a place where we can express are likes and dislikes regarding daily activities,Twitter fails because if they don't like your tweet they will misspell words or just eliminate what you said.They allow people to Lambeth President Trump but don't say anything about Biden or Kamella Harris or they will lock your account.they locked mine for the last time! Bye your nothing but a censor
Twitter,2020-08-30T12:59:53+00:00,4,I've been using Twitter not just for entertainment but also to connect with friends and/or family. Although there are contents that is really disturbing, I am able to report it anyway.
Twitter,2020-08-28T23:05:49+00:00,1,This group doesn't seem to believe in freedom of speech. They block free speech and Tweets regularly. Don't support them. They are on the dark side!
Twitter,2020-08-20T22:29:11+00:00,5,One of the best social media platforms, i love it :)
Twitter,2020-08-19T12:44:51+00:00,4,It is an amazing social media platform. On Twitter, I have interacted with a lot of people from different cultures and places. I also get updated on what is happening in the other part of the globe. I love it.
Twitter,2020-08-18T11:36:02+00:00,1,Awful site run by very unscrupulous people.
Twitter,2020-08-12T09:25:14+00:00,5,This platform really helps to stay update. Thank you
Twitter,2020-08-10T13:00:31+00:00,1,Oh twitter you foolish site 🤡🤡🤡 I love how people attack each other just for saying an opinion, or even ignoring.  F you too Twitter 😘
Twitter,2020-08-10T09:30:32+00:00,4,I enjoy Twitter. However, it has revolved nowadays to be a place for negativity. What I do is, I mute those accounts and clean my timeline every now and then.
Twitter,2020-08-07T09:45:26+00:00,1,Hijacked my account wont let me access to it or to delete it.
Twitter,2020-08-03T08:22:18+00:00,5,Keeping people updated on the current news and helping us establish a connection with anyone around the world. Thanks to Twitter, all of these are possible.
Twitter,2020-08-02T07:52:30+00:00,4,Such an amazing social media platform, I can keep up with my friends and see the news all over the world, although some of the content is disturbing, I am able to report it.
Twitter,2020-08-01T09:55:18+00:00,1,Sponsored content, political censorship, super biased and superficial/outraging content. Anything on twitter is bad
Twitter,2020-07-31T22:12:34+00:00,1,What I learn today, If you are a minority twitter will kill your account, if you disagree with a rich left winger.
Twitter,2020-07-30T15:05:11+00:00,1,Twitter is a racist dismissive vehicle for dissemination of communist and fascist messaging to tear down the fabric of American culture.
Twitter,2020-07-29T10:01:41+00:00,5,I've been using this to keep myself updated on the latest news and get connected to my friends on social media. And it's great!
Twitter,2020-07-28T01:40:55+00:00,5,Although this may be unclaimed, but Twitter is the best. I recommend it any day any time.
Twitter,2020-07-27T13:11:04+00:00,4,None

They Symphony Kitchens of Castlebar Co Mayo even demanded I pay the full amount before the kitchen was fitted .The kitchets units had different doorsand a cracked sink .They haven't returned my calls to fix the kitchen.They are terrible and should not be selling kitchens .

Twitter,2020-07-20T04:54:07+00:00,1,Well it's a place to get quick fun info about different subjects but it's overrun by really juvenile politics, "liberal" United States bullies that ruin everything and whine when they don't get what they want and make fun of everyone outside their own little ideas.  What started out a good idea got trashed, just like IMdB.  Railroaded by narrow minded liberal kid trolls that think they're the only ones in the world.
Twitter,2020-07-19T15:19:27+00:00,1,Twitter sucks and blocks any comments they don’t agree with.
Twitter,2020-07-19T14:40:07+00:00,3,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times" - that's how I feel about Twitter. Great for connecting people, humor, sharing info. Horrible for bullying, trolling and lying. I'm over it for the meantime.

Twitter,2020-07-12T17:24:35+00:00,1,Twitter is another social media site amongst the top but wears a phony crown upon its head.When it first began, it may have been very good, but as time passed, politics took over as it has with so many others and now conservative posts subject the author to shadow banning. The only way you can truly survive is if you follow the narrative of the left-wing.This site needs to be reformed.
Twitter,2020-07-11T20:49:50+00:00,1,Possibly being controlled by Right wing Governments & unsurprisingly with the lack of enforcement of local tax laws.... The decision to stop certain right wing individuals names from trending & the upholding of suspensions to accounts who clearly haven’t breached hate rules, but may have used colourful language, is a clear attempt to stifle free speech from people criticising Current governments. But money talks & like a lot of Social media technology companies, the willingness to be controlled or influence behaviour for political capital has become too much & it is time for new platforms to start eroding their market share.
Twitter,2020-07-09T14:35:31+00:00,1,absolute mess to try and reset a password, retrieve username.. Ended up opening a new account as twitter was not able to recognize me based on my phone number and correct password. So then tried to loggin.. error .. two users have this number. LOL. i was trying to use twitter to get some news on a specific thing. hopefully i won't have to use it again..
Twitter,2020-07-05T01:00:43+00:00,1,Forgot my password and it took me a few trials. Then liked a few posts and apparently it was enough to automatically suspend my account. You would think it should be possible to resolve this quickly, but no. It's been a week after the appeal and no reply from the company whatsoever. So if you need a reliable platform for communication (which I personally think is extrmeley important) - Twitter is not it.
Twitter,2020-07-04T17:21:44+00:00,1,Left wing echo chamber. Twitter suspends accounts for very little justification. Censorship gone mad.
Twitter,2020-07-04T12:57:53+00:00,1,Terrible, they will sell your data to third parties not to mention it being an echo chamber for the far left that can’t think outside of their msm bubble.Full of blatant racism and Islamic ideology
Twitter,2020-06-26T20:26:25+00:00,1,A worrying 1 star... this site has lost all credibility, in one simple action.Users can not edit their posts, but a few of my post have been edited.changing the words blacklivesmatter to Blakelivemater, at first i though , well there is a small chance i made typo, so i looked at my other post..blacklivesmatter was changed to Britishlivesmatter, a tag no one was using when i posted the post, nor have used personal (nor relates to the post its self).(they also changes UKBLM to BLMUK in a post where i pointed out possible liabilities)This means i did not type those words, but twitter has post edited my post and made it look like i wrote something i did not.Twitter is meant to be a platform, but it has used editorial practices. and has also impersonated (hijacked) my account by making it appear i wrote content i did not.This was not my account being hacked, as the user can not edit posts, even if the account was compromised. This was done on twitters end.In summery. Twitter is actively changing moderate content to polarise sides by editing users posts.my twitter posts where edited by swapping out my hash tags with ones that spark pointless arguments.
Twitter,2020-06-26T12:43:20+00:00,1,Terrible. Very bias company. Unless you support the lefties views, they will censor and shadowban your tweets like crazy.My account got suspended just because I was expressing my support for President Trump, with no prior warning or notice. I did not breach any of the rules.And whilst now being suspended they won't let me delete my account. Meaning they are keeping all my personal data on their system without my consent!!Also the "trends" are always something that insults President Trump. Very unprofessional, toxic, mob mentality bully-like environment and culture.You will and won't silence our voices!!I have moved over to Parler and prefer the free speech!!#Conservatives #Twexit #Parler

So they are violating my data protection, theives!!!
Twitter,2020-06-19T23:06:33+00:00,1,Twitter is full of sex workers, fake promotion accounts for them and porn... and both girls/boys but 99.99% mainly young girls selling themselves on subscription sites like onlyfans, admireme, frisk, revealme etc, and escorting sites like adultwork etc and putting naked, half naked or sexually suggestive images and videos on their tweets.They are also spamming their and alot of other pages aswell saying join my page for £____ and see 1000+ content etc etc.When all of these tweets and profiles are reported they are not looked at and most of the tweets reported they dont come back plus they haven't even looked so report them again and they still haven't and they not been took down.There needs to be a email for twitter so can email about them aswell so that these profiles, tweets etc can be taken down for good and banning these people

Twitter,2020-06-14T22:01:41+00:00,1,Be careful what you post on Twitter because it is more than likely that someone will have something negative to say that isn't grossly rude and not allowed based on the company's terms and conditions.Even worse, when you report the users that are attacking you for your opinion, Twitter will not take any action, allowing these users to continue on with being toxic and antagonizing others without receiving any form of punishment.Stay away from Twitter.
Twitter,2020-06-14T16:18:19+00:00,1,Donald Hicks is a power hungry moron.He runs the twitter support team. I filed complaints of transphhobia and homophobia, asked why they did nothing against these accounts, so they banned ME and my partner. My partner did nothing but ask why I was suspended. Twitter support is an absolute joke, mad with power and seems to have a dark, bigoted agenda. Horrible, horrible people.
Twitter,2020-06-11T13:35:05+00:00,1,Horrible, toxic platform, that puts up with abuse and political rubbish, only taking things down when it suits them or recieves publicity. They'll happily demand you to verify your phone number after you make an account (why not part of the process?) but won't remove violating content. Poor support. Bad interface.

Twitter told me that the page DID VIOLATE their terms etc.  But instead of removing the page, they protected the pages tweets, so no one could see them without sending a request.

Twitter,2020-05-21T11:02:34+00:00,1,Interesting development. I have been suspended from Twitter. The reason......they say I was promoting hateful conduct and discriminating against race. What makes this interesting is I actually was responding to a tweet from Tomi Lauren, who was defending the two men who brutally gunned down Ahmaud Arbery. I told her she was disgusting for defending those men and a sub-human. I accused her of being racist. For that I was banned from Twitter. I gave twitter multiple examples of tweets, hers and others from that base that were actually racist and ones that clearly incited violence but to no avail. Clearly, Twitter is bought and paid for. Lesson learned.

Twitter,2020-04-02T16:10:16+00:00,1,Useless organisation keeps suspending accounts. Complete waste of your time using this social media platform.
Twitter,2020-03-27T16:22:05+00:00,2,Twitter: where leftists hippies and cop haters go to cry
Twitter,2020-03-25T00:44:28+00:00,4,I find interesting that many DeviantArt users move here since Tumblr allegedly is trash (I don´t know the web at all). Otherwise just like Facebook but the ethics don´t require real identities of users.
Twitter,2020-03-21T23:19:14+00:00,5,Amazing site. No problems. Easy to use
Twitter,2020-03-18T20:30:16+00:00,5,Asian with bubble buttvisit this guy
Twitter,2020-03-15T15:23:54+00:00,1,Easily one of the most trash & racist social media sites i have come across, although sometimes absolutely hilarious, you can’t do 2 thumb scrolls without stumbling across anti-white sentiment. The hate that is shown on this site really brings out the worst in people in this generation
Twitter,2020-03-14T17:19:03+00:00,4,Great site let down by weird people it suffers what Facebook does towards of trolling and there are accounts that have bot followers and just because they paint they are special?WELCOME TO TWITTER that stuff is all over here I sign in and I mean really all I am doing is sharing gaming footage + news, and just because of that makes me not have many followers so a easy target for troll bait.I target right back! I can program and everything the site suffers heavily on bullying like 1 vs 20, cause that's the way it's like in real life you been right in the argurment or wrong I laugh so hard though when I'm a 100% correct and a YouTuber has to position his old tweets back on a fake account been a one man army trying to troll :) not Twitters fault it can't --- out right banish it.Also on that note f* big YouTubersContent on here is prime however, I see: good news, gaming, art, memes, and a lot more in wide range of aspect of stuff random at times. Site is prime for fan-dome probably best site there is for the fan-dome - seen all types of content from adult to minor and the just plain weird, you can make friends but still there are risks on here which it is let down by the trust factor of why you have a weird follower.So much to say. I like also how I don't need my name up I just need information that proves where am at for security reasons or whatever unlike Facebook where there system is so deep when you are legit person signing up one post or even passed entry is a auto boot when you haven't done anything.On that note on Twitter (mixed in thousands) I've been hacked once in like 7-8 year compared to Facebook where it was like all the time and all the time I suffered with to much info been up.
Twitter,2020-03-11T12:16:19+00:00,5,I think that twitter is the last service among oldschool giants (like FB and instagram) where people are free to share their ideas. Also great way to feel yourself close to celebrities.
Twitter,2020-03-11T03:05:58+00:00,1,There’s no way to search my contacts to add people I know. U can synch them but it doesn’t do any good it still reccomend a a bunch of celebrities it’s a stupid app with no point it needs to be made illegal cuz it’s consuming time and ruining lives I hate it
Twitter,2020-03-05T03:31:23+00:00,1,I don't know where people went to act like fools before Twitter. I've never seen so many nasty hateful people on any site before. Neo Nazis kluxxers woman haters all posting obscenities and abuse. Dreadful
Twitter,2020-03-01T17:44:49+00:00,1,How is it possible to screw something so simple like twitter up?
Twitter,2020-02-25T11:54:36+00:00,1,A Democrat/leftist paradise..  If you lean as a centrist or lean right stay away.  It's a cesspool of leftist hatred a bastion that Twitter Boss Dorsey and top folks fully support.
Twitter,2020-02-21T11:54:08+00:00,3,None
Twitter,2020-02-21T10:44:28+00:00,1,Twitter is a leftist pool of political crap. If you disagree they boot you off. Basically TWITTER sucks. Leftist propaganda site for antifa and black lives don't matter.
Twitter,2020-02-20T00:28:55+00:00,1,Have been locked out of my Twitter account for months.  Have tried all of their self help ideas to fix the problem.  I keep getting Twitter notifications to my email so I know my account is still active, but I can't get into it.  I have tried resetting the password dozens of times to no avail.  Always the same result, an error message saying the username and password aren't found or something like unable to process request.  I finally wrote a long ticket to their support folks and then got robo answers with the same self help crap that I had already tried dozens of times.  Write another stronger worded support ticket and still get somewhat of a robo answer, but it at least said to reply to that email and they would help me.  ONly to try that and get a message saying my ticket had expired a few days later and have to start all over again, only to get another robo answer with same self help tips.
Twitter,2020-02-17T05:50:05+00:00,3,It's good to follow interesting people but they let people register twitter handles that sit idle for years.
Twitter,2020-02-16T01:07:25+00:00,1,I'm on twitter..I also have a man that's cyberstalking me..hes banned from twitter however hes made 2 more accounts at the same time n used them to attack me..now I have reported his 2 burner accounts I've also told twitter they have a cyberstalker on their platform..I asked them for help..well the cyberstalker is still on twitter one account is banned one account is burner n one account is inactive..I dont plan on staying much longer I dont want to subject myself to a cyberstalkers attacks.its been 6 months dealing with this creep n twitter dont care.even if you ask for help.i hide n he finds me..this cyberstalkers name is michael mitreski apparently theres a app that will allow one to use fake numbers n make numerous  accounts..not good of  TWITTER..wheres the justice in that!! Would you agree?
Twitter,2020-02-14T23:34:57+00:00,1,It would be helpful and rather nice if Twitter would actually except my personal information so that I can join.I used to be a member, but Twitter will not accept my log in details. You can, apparently log in with Facebook. Twitter will not accept this information either. The system wants to send a link for the password. I have changed my email address and I cannot make Twitter recognise my new one.The old one is unusable. A lot of wasted time.
Twitter,2020-02-13T16:17:40+00:00,1,Have been repeatedly suspended for supporting BDS and criticizing the Israeli regimes appalling treatment of Palestinians.All it takes is a small group of people to coordinate a Complaint about your Twitter account to get suspended.
Twitter,2020-02-11T06:12:52+00:00,1,Awful platform. Protects racists and sexual predators. If you dare to call out a clearly racist account or a bully as I did  you're suspended with zero reason given. Numerous accounts reported for racism and Twitter responds they were doing nothing wrong. Stay away from this cesspool, joined it for sport and transfer updates. Left it due to the unbridled hate, racism and bullying that Twitter clearly encourages.
Twitter,2020-02-05T13:08:24+00:00,1,Lousy editorsNegative critique on twitter , your account will be closed.Twitter is political in the background.
Twitter,2020-02-02T23:45:09+00:00,1,Twitter is useless and a platform based on dictatorship.
Twitter,2020-02-02T09:08:49+00:00,5,Twitter is the best app. Every celebrities having a Twitter account. U can follow them.
Twitter,2020-02-01T09:01:18+00:00,1,I tried to advertise on twitter. But I failed. So, I won't use it.
Twitter,2020-02-01T04:00:03+00:00,1,A platform run by millennial muppets who make jellyfish look like lifeforms with a spine
Twitter,2020-01-31T23:03:10+00:00,1,I signed up with my email and within five minutes, Twitter tried to force me to enter my phone number. They're NOT getting my phone number. I value my privacy and I certainly don't want text message charges, SO NOT USING TWITTER. It does NOT respect user's privacy!!!
Twitter,2020-01-31T17:12:08+00:00,1,Twitter is a biased left wing extremist social platform with 70% or more fake accounts. These nasty trolls are hate filled keyboard warriors. Today is Brexit day in the UK. Hash tag Happy Brexit Day should be trending. However, left wing Twitter has deliberately hijacked this day to promote hash tags I am European,  Not My Brexit, etc. Twitter should be thoroughly ashamed for being a left wing biased social media company. There was exactly similar pattern seen after US Presidential Elections when Twitter promoted hashtag Not My President. I’ve logged a formal complaint with OfCom and Prime Ministers Office to crackdown on biased left wing troll companies like Twitter where more than 70% accounts are fake.
Twitter,2020-01-30T09:06:33+00:00,1,Had an online sexual predator (affordable leather) harassing me trying to promote prostitution for 2 days, I blocked 3 accounts associated with this person but they came back with a 4th account, I reported all accounts several times, however Twitter banned my account for "harassment" while leaving the predators account free to continue. Considering wether to hand screenshots & information to mainstream media as I feel the public need to be made aware that Twitter side with online sexual predators
Twitter,2020-01-28T22:38:01+00:00,1,Twitter doesn't let users have another chance to fix their settings if they've mispelt/mistyped something.For example: They locked my account just because I ACCIDENTLY put in 2007 instead of 2005. My finger slipped!!!
Twitter,2020-01-27T16:55:46+00:00,4,Good for me to get backlinks to my websites for ranking purposes.Used by many people
Twitter,2020-01-27T02:40:13+00:00,1,Why bother, useful information is minimal, self-promotion to the max.
Twitter,2020-01-26T17:02:19+00:00,4,Works ok for me but they should invest more cash in blocking bots.
Twitter,2020-01-24T17:37:30+00:00,1,Dictators run this site. Allow lies and fake news from politicians but block accounts that call out these fat cat lies. Someone at  Twitter is accepting fat brown envelopes from westminster, guaranteed!!
Twitter,2020-01-19T02:26:07+00:00,1,Twitter face hook etc...work and payed on favour of trump like people.those websites  and similar are not safe.they commiting and committed many many hidden crimes.they don't follow of EU or Asia policy and escaped from many crimes for now but the judgement to come.they are remind of broken hands of unwelcome imperialism and they will get cut off in future from our society. I urge uk politicians too to follow China,Iran,Russia to create their own social media and payments systems.I am also follower of @leader_movments which banned and I followed via twitter but twitter violated its international legacy and never I was follower of my leader in reality because of Trickiness of twitter and face book.probably they avoid thousands of followers to reach to @leader_movment.i heard that one of twitte  of @leader_movment had 500 likes after twitter re verified the account again and again and again 500 likes all disappeared to 10 likes and all followers were removed.twitter and face book owners and staffs are real modern evils and criminals.we will deal with them in future legally.they payed and work on favour of Trump like people and very very little rich individuals which they will be spending their future life in jales.justic will be enforced.
Twitter,2020-01-15T14:07:20+00:00,1,I can not set up account, telling me my e-mail phone number does not valid
Twitter,2020-01-12T22:21:07+00:00,1,Blue criminals.twitter etc..are new designs of mafia but the old mafia had manhood.this rootless fake lions with no teeth threatening the world democracy and created alot of inequalities.they are not likeable.i never liked them.i never trusted them.they sale  people informations to individuals for afew AmericanBuffaloes.they will never have me in their website as quest.we will put and will restrict them all around the world from West Asia until usa.they will feel the pain& effect constantly.take care
Twitter,2020-01-12T21:29:29+00:00,1,Twitter,face book,Ebay PayPal etc...are arms and  the remain of the death imperialism of us and trump like people.They created lot of inequalities which soon will create revolutions in many parts of usa and Europe.i had twitter,twitter did not allow my followers reach to me.i had 500 likes when I re verified my accounts 500 become 20 likes.they allow to create millions of fake profiles for person like trump and they isolate the real people.such a platform is not safe.Many many image of nudy children's were and are on twitter and google face book etc...for many many years and when we complained and asked them to remove them they suspended our account.they already have many enemy's around the world and their future is very bad.twitter!we are not in the world which two person could share the countries and give it to their friends.we are in the century which people are wise and aware,they may not tell you about your crimes but they kept in their brain so careful you are going to a very bad direction which you choosed to go.
Twitter,2020-01-09T18:37:47+00:00,1,No warning suspended!!I've been on Twitter @Daminous_Purity since December 2009 and now 10 years later, 418k followers, followed by friends, celebrities, sports teams etc and I'm auto suspended for false claims of abuse and harassment as acorsing to the "bot appeal" states which is absolute copy/paste garbage. What has happened to this company when it's now full of snowflakes and PC liberals who censor free speech and hand out verification ticks to every criminal going.Twitter now is filled with underage kids, post and spamming, drugs, sex trafficking and my god their own terms of service and policies even now encourage "Paedophilia and child exploitation" as acceptable behaviour???? Even at that it's filled with "underage kids" even posting nudes of themselves to their "YouTube idols and hero's"... It's absolutely sickening!! It's laughable how they claim freedom of speech and diversity and yet auto suspend honest people while continuing to protect every criminality and toxic piece of society. I've had 10 years of abuse hurled at me, profile cloned, mocked, spammed and not once has Twitter done anything against those who break the rules. Yet the moment you fight back against the cancerous abusers along comes Twitter and "you're suspended" and get handed a bot review while the criminality continues mocking and slandering youTwitter use to be good, But as NO warnings they suspend you. I've now reported them to the FTC and the Better Business Bureau as this site has gone right down the toilet.This site more and more is becoming an "Echo Chamber"  of one way only allowed speech.What a disgrace!
Twitter,2020-01-09T13:28:30+00:00,5,Policy says waiting for Twitter
Twitter,2020-01-07T03:50:37+00:00,5,Very good social app. I have never had problems with twitter. It is a very good digital marketing tool too. When you will grow your followers you can start even small affiliate business there.Nice UI design, easy operational, short messages. It is good.
Twitter,2020-01-02T19:24:39+00:00,1,MOST CLUELESS PERSON IN SF, CHANGED A BUSINESS PROFILE DATE TO MATCH WITH THE CREATION DATE AND IT LOCKED THE ACCOUNT AND WANTS MY INFO, DOWN WITH JACK DORSEY!
Twitter,2019-12-31T12:38:41+00:00,1,This is nonsence!! I correct my birth date from 1997 to 1998 and they blocl my account saying Im not old enough to use twitter!What ia worng why you people?!?! Cant they do maths or something?!?!?!Now they want my ID card... shame on you twitter!
Twitter,2019-12-26T16:27:36+00:00,1,I got suspended for call that Fox News who.re @JudgeJeanine a who.re for having a dumb believe that Trump "saved" Christmas. If you're too scared to say Merry Christmas because you think you'll get murdered or attacked, then you're a dumbass like that who.re. Of course, Trump got away scotts free despite attacking people all over with actual hateful conducts. Typical conservatives snowflakes of Twitter.
Twitter,2019-12-21T20:31:31+00:00,1,My twitter account got locked 3 (three) minutes after signup through email address. Never got a chance to write one single tweet nor reply to any existing tweets, not even browse through tweets of possible interest to me. It asks now for a cell phone number which I do not have because I don't need one. Not even once was a phone number mentioned as an absolute requirement during signup. Sneaky, dishonest and terrible platform. I should have researched other people's reviews before signing up. I will never use again and I truly not recommend.
Twitter,2019-12-10T19:47:20+00:00,5,Me gusta esta red social, tiene poca censura.
Twitter,2019-12-10T11:32:37+00:00,1,This company will ban you if you suggest that terrorist murderers are scumbags and should face capital punishment. Unbelievable
Twitter,2019-12-09T05:42:06+00:00,1,I was permanently banned for using the word c*nt. I appealed the decision but was basically told to go f myself. I see other people making death threats and only get a 12 hour ban.
Twitter,2019-12-06T16:53:24+00:00,4,For me, its twitter over other social media platforms. But I will see how their new terms & conditions go & that might change. But I prefer that Twitter are more open than other social platforms, especially in the industry I work in. They do need an edit tweet button. The only real negative at this stage and makes me give 4 stars as opposed to 5 is that I am shadow banned.
Twitter,2019-12-03T23:31:46+00:00,1,I can't even post a tweet because of their silly phone verification "you are already using this number" message after registering. What a joke. I even messaged support about it twice and never get a reply from them.
Twitter,2019-11-28T16:21:54+00:00,1,None
Twitter,2019-11-19T12:46:58+00:00,1,Tried to follow a few people and got blocked!! Now its saying I need a verification number and they will call with it but no callAnd when I try and reset my password it says no such email, But funny that as they email me to that very same email address.  I need my account unblocked !!!!
Twitter,2019-11-19T10:18:47+00:00,1,I am so annoyed with twitter.I opened account last week for first time.It keeps asking me if I'm a blasted robot and making me take tests to continue!Pathetic twitter.I spent alot of time tweeting about a specific thing that happened to me.Twitter, for some reason just are not posting my tweets.No 3rd party names, no abusive words etc etc.Trying to contact them is a nightmare.I filled in contact form and it then said I had missed filling in  some "fields" they said they hi luted in red but nothing was read and every field was filled in. Still wud not let me submit my complaint.I'm so angry with twitter.Then I looked at reviews of twitter and it dosnt make for good reading!!Contact me and explain to me pls twitter.TES.@TS26607768
Twitter,2019-11-11T19:57:23+00:00,5,I've been on for years & have had no trouble from Twitter at all. Had a couple of creeps wanting dates but I blocked and reported. Would suggest Twitter any time!

Twitter,2019-11-05T19:02:42+00:00,1,Oh dear!  Twitter you are not only useless at customer services I bet you get cussed at a lot for rubbing folks up the wrong way!You block/stop accounts then tell the account holders to sort the problem! How unhelpful is that!!  I have an account that's been blocked for over a year while I'm waiting to see if you decide to reinstate it or not. My dogs account was blocked/stopped when I put his correct age in his profile. Got emails from GetHuman asking if I'd fix the problem!! Problems nothing to do with me, Twitter instigated the matter, down to Twitter to unblock/stop!Had great fun barking with other dogs, made lots of friends, something to look forward to on tea break. En joyed using my account, keeping up with charities I support, NFU - being a member I can keep up to date with issues on Twitter and support pet lost and found with R.T.s.!Twitter lets down Twitter users very badly, to the point of insulting them!  I would not recommend Twitter - in fact keep well away! I'd have give - stars if possible!
Twitter,2019-11-05T11:13:41+00:00,5,I use twitter everyday i love it so muchkeep up the good work guys
Twitter,2019-11-04T15:06:27+00:00,1,Infested with bots an scams. The moderation team instead of focusing on the real issues, prefers to focus on trivial matters
Twitter,2019-10-29T01:56:55+00:00,5,Best source for news especially in this fay and age. Cant live without Twitter!
Twitter,2019-10-27T21:41:46+00:00,4,Give bad reviews to almost everything out there, because almost everything these days is a scam or just trash. But Twitter is pretty good, and even though the new interface completely sucks, you get used to it. One of the better social media sites. Way way way superior to Facebook.
Twitter,2019-10-25T05:12:19+00:00,5,Useful if you know what you're information you're looking for or want to be made aware of.Use sparingly and don't follow anyone because if you do, you won't be able to see through the maze.
Twitter,2019-10-15T12:28:33+00:00,1,They blocked my account with 13.000 followers without any reason... :(
Twitter,2019-10-14T14:09:28+00:00,1,Terrible company, suspend your account for very little yet others swear, abuse people, bully, incite suicide & when you report them Twitter say its within the rules.Honestly only thing twitter is good for is getting to customer service reps when things go wrong. Other than that it's a giant cess pool of racism, classism, mysogynism, bullying, islamaphobia, suicide incitement, body shaming and just about any other nasty vicious thing going. I'd avoid it if you can they'll only sell all your data too I suspect.
Twitter,2019-10-10T03:00:20+00:00,1,Very poor, suspended my account for on reason
Twitter,2019-10-06T20:19:42+00:00,1,Steals you’re personal data & is extremely bias against conservatives
Twitter,2019-10-05T20:05:44+00:00,1,Twitter customer service is not helpful at all. I have been trying to deactivate my account for three years now and I have not been able to do so. My account was locked due to "suspicious activity" and then I could not log back in because the email set up with the twitter account is no longer in service.
Twitter,2019-10-04T03:37:35+00:00,2,Trash site,not good.
Twitter,2019-10-04T01:50:48+00:00,1,Twitter sucks if you are a trump fan watch out what you say you'll be suspended every other day.. but I really don't give care! God forbid if you reply to a liberal it's okay the left is rude and crude but if you say something off color your account gets suspended for 12 hours they can kiss my back END‼️
Twitter,2019-10-01T10:36:59+00:00,1,would prefer to give a negative but no option. Twitter have suspended my account with no option to have it reinstated - Im not bothered about that but what is annoying is their total bias for celebrities, politicians and the rich and famous to be able to say anything and use foul language without suspension whereas Joe Public gets suspended for expressing an opinion. The are totally biased and against free speech unless you are in the public eye  it is disgusting. I have tried to deactivate my account but twitter rule wont let me so have asked on 3 separate occasions for them to do it as I no longer wish to be associated with them and as yet they haven't done it. I would find a better social media outlet if you are considering signing up to twitter - the rules are ridiculous.
Twitter,2019-09-27T12:57:58+00:00,4,Always loved twitter.Twill take a while to get used to the new look
Twitter,2019-09-21T21:48:27+00:00,1,Also would like to mention that twitter don't bloke or suspend accounts that are famous actors or people with alot of followers as they seem to use a lot of bad language but that is exceptable by twitter shame on you twitter your rules stink 😡 😡 😡
Twitter,2019-09-21T21:17:37+00:00,1,Twitter is a joke they suspended my account for swearing 🤬 but they have far more worse accounts on twitter which they don't suspend like people having sex with dogs and other animals too, and abusive videos of people abusing animals in a horrific way but that seems to be exceptable they should get there priorities right twitter should be suspended too, shame on you twitter people will voice their opinions wather you like it or not twitter rules are a joke too and for your information there are other better sites than twitter where they don't suspend you for voicing your opinion
Twitter,2019-09-13T20:14:55+00:00,1,I hate Twitter!!!!!! My account was hacked!!! Support didn't answer or answer only one template answers!!! What's going on???
Twitter,2019-09-12T14:44:50+00:00,1,Extremely biased left radical organization letting spreading anti conservative hate and threats. This website has to be closed for allowing migrants spreading racism against white and especially against german ppl.I've seen this ongoing for months and always reported and nothing happened, but then they blocked my account, but not the offenders account.
Twitter,2019-09-09T23:30:52+00:00,1,Go to hell you biased low lifes
Twitter,2019-09-08T18:07:59+00:00,3,I’m really tired of the constant requests of my phone confirmations! WAHT"S WRONG?? and a new Twitter design! I was quite happy with the previous one.
Twitter,2019-09-07T07:42:27+00:00,1,I tried twitter for a month what a poisonous form of contact. Closed account have taken the advice of experts no social media as it is mainly the mentally ill contributing
Twitter,2019-09-05T05:03:29+00:00,1,Just a biased echo chamber, they suspend right wing accounts for any small infringement but will allow left wing accounts to stay for much worse offences, it's a biased platform which has been taken over by socialists, not worth bothering with.
Twitter,2019-09-03T17:08:54+00:00,1,My account was hacked and then suspended for hateful conduct several hours later. I have been trying to login all day and was unable to. When I finally reset my password it said it was suspended for hateful conduct. I have filed numerous appeals and no one even reads them just automated bots. This has caused me much distress because I am now being harassed and receiving  death threats  on other platforms for tweets that are not mine. You dont care at all!!! @Parfanity
Twitter,2019-08-28T22:26:28+00:00,1,I follow all twitter guideline and rules though I follow mostly conservatives. I believe that is the reason my account is suspended every other day and to unlock my account I have to prove I’m not a robot. You would think after them asking the first 10 to 15 times to prove I’m not a robot they would be satisfied. They are harassing me due to my political affiliation. In addition I found out they “deboost” my replies, which prevents most others from seeing them. Again I stress I follow all their rules and regulations. Hopefully with enough people complaining maybe we can get the FCC to regulate them.
Twitter,2019-08-24T23:10:11+00:00,1,Clearly anyone can report an adversary who may be a bot or hater. Twitter staff does not read to verify if rules are broken. There are known people here who do break the rules without punishment. Thisshould be challenged for ‘the people’. Appeals? There’s no contact info that is credible. None! Professional services here stinks. No regard for their clients who pay for immeasurably wealth. Also, hire mixed culture staff. That matters with language and expression.
Twitter,2019-08-24T14:41:22+00:00,1,Where is the negative star rating?  Very sad that Twitter is scared of conservative tweets. They allow 24/7 vile rants & profanity against POTUS but kick us off for no reason. 👌we shall remember you Twitter 👌
Twitter,2019-08-23T14:01:42+00:00,1,If Trustpilot had a negative Star Section I'd rate twitter ( -10 ) because they're one of the worst social networks for not responding to its Web Posting Media. I'm unable to find any information on how to Contact Twitter Directly. Apparently, Twitter is blocking my account with no chance for reactivation which has been blocked for whatever reason without given notice as to why. I don't recommend Twitter and it should be avoided unless you want to be writing here.The Issue:-- The email address used to file this request does not match the email on the account you mentioned. -- Sorry, that page doesn’t exist! -- We couldn't find that number. Please try again. are the responses from Twitter Contact Forms --  And there is "No Number Contact or address" that I can find.--------Sending The Issue----------I need login and account support ------I can't log in to my account or My account is hacked or compromised----------Apparently, someone has High Jacked My account or compromised  my Twitter Account. I've tried servile times to Contact Twitter however, they keep send E-Mails telling my E-Mail does not match their Record and they can not find the number. Did I miss something in the word High Jacked or compromised?Here's what I further did. I went to Contact Us, selected "I need login and account support," then "My account is hacked or compromised," which took me to  "Your Twitter username @" in which I completed. Then: I have to enter in my email and a description of the issues I'm having. I also went there and used their Number Verification system. After that, here comes the email: "Your email does not match our records and Number can not be found."That sounds Hacked or compromised to me or their System is Screwed up royally.How can you contact them Directly in a matter like this? I can not find another way. #twitter
Twitter,2019-08-22T21:30:30+00:00,3,1. It's pretty good except for account's being locked all the time after they have been made because of "automatic behavior" when they weren't giving any "automated behavior".2. You should let people make accounts like how they make accounts on "DrawCast", "Google++", and without emails that have been verified or made into gmail (or any other type of email accounts).3. Suspend people who are bullying others.4. Get rid of the block button.(I will edit this later)
Twitter,2019-08-18T12:31:39+00:00,1,Twitter is one of the worst social networks (after blocking my account there is no chance for reactivation) the account has been blocked for any reason.I don't recommend Twiter, avoid it.
Twitter,2019-08-12T21:56:39+00:00,1,Toxic website full of troubled people to sound like better than the other. Stay away from this one people. It's not worth it
Twitter,2019-08-10T17:48:20+00:00,1,Had Been A Member Since 2015, Used Site Regularly  Since Then Suddenly The Açcount Is Deactivated By Twitter On 02/08/2019.- No Explanations.
Twitter,2019-08-10T17:40:54+00:00,1,I signed up on twitter, no problems then when I tried to login again discovered the account had mysteriously been suspended.Have been told by others this is common practice for the twitter site
Twitter,2019-08-10T16:33:42+00:00,1,It is too easy to create a fake profile on Twitter. You do not have to document that you are actually the person you want to create a profile for. But when you are trying to help a friend to remove an obvious impersonating, insulting, personally damaging, ugly fake profile which involves photos of a child minor of age the administration of Twitter demands an unreasonable amount of documentation. They do not accept national photo ID as the sole proof, They apparently do not look at or evaluate the presentation of the profile. They seem only to have an numeric interest in the number of users in the competition with other social medias....causing this way serious, damaging consecuenses to the life of the person who are suffering from the act of a bad person creating a fake profile in the name of another person publicing a false an negative image of this very same person. Come on, Twitter, You can do better than that. E.g. respect european laws AND in general your very own clients. It seems that Your company lacks a comon sense of ethics. Prove me wrong and I would be delighted to remove this coment and recomend your social media for the future. report 0123054766    [ ref:_00DA0K0A8._5004A1kU9nD:ref ]Sincerely yoursJakob B.

Twitter,2019-08-09T12:57:42+00:00,1,This is f****** ridiculous! In less than 24 hours my account was locked because of "hateful conduct" fine, appealed because I personally don't think it was but I'll just delete it if they ignore my appeal. Went to sleep and woke up to see that EVERY SINGLE TWEET OF MINE HAS BEEN REPORTED BY VIOLATING THE RULES. This time it's "abuse/harassment.This is all because I had an argument with a troll who blocked me after insulting me first and closing off with insults and when I actually defended myself he was offended and now wants to play victim and Twitter are essentially letting him. He's spam reporting because he's still salty that I didn't back down and now he and they are punishing me for it. If anything HE'S the harrasser because he's reported every single comment, even the ones who had nothing abusive about it. How THE F*** is saying "You poor thing" and "Anyone would be dumb to not check the system requirements" abuse or harassment??!?!?! According to Twitter, you dare not tag anyone otherwise you are harassing them. I guess anytime you look at someone's profile, you are sexually abusing them. 🤦🏾‍♀️This is DISGUSTING.Update:Now they just said they apologized for the "error" for ONE TWEET. The rest especially the "Aww poor thing" tweet is in serious breach of abuse or harassment. Someone is going trigger happy, they just ban and block left right and centre without a care in the world? Check more into the situation? Nah, just gonna press that button and continue eating. Ignorant buffoons.I already didn't like Twitter thus not using it often now I definitely won't, and if they just randomly delete my account out of the blue which I feel they will, I will praise the lord that I'm finally out of that cesspool of hypocrisy.I've had one troll that their entire account was dedicated to hating others, examples condescending and violent tweets about Black people, Muslims, Gay people, Women, Animals, and Disabled people. Their account was up for months without any action. Their YouTube also considered of hate videos of the above mentioned. Again, no action was taken. Only months later their account was locked or suspended after about 100 warnings.SERIOUSLY, F*** TWITTER.
Twitter,2019-08-08T11:26:42+00:00,4,Twitter is the best social media platform for sharing both casual and formal information to family friends and business partners
Twitter,2019-08-07T10:34:10+00:00,1,Very hard to get hold of customer support
Twitter,2019-07-31T16:04:02+00:00,5,I like using twitter and reading lots of the tweets. it has some news but i just read it to see what other people are into.it's like the pulse of people with piles of free time. I think most of the users are probably unemployed or housewives.
Twitter,2019-07-29T14:34:09+00:00,1,Extremely terrible service. Your account will be locked for violating the terms of service when you didn't do anything wrong, but blatant transphobia gets a free pass.You will be left for days while they pretend a real person is reading your appeal, then instantly give you an automated response after a few days. Twitter is genuinely a nice idea as an app, but unfortunately the employees themselves are an embarrassment. Additionally, they ignore user feedback and despite being told that nobody likes the new layout, they force it on you anyway. My advice is to stay away from this app as it is genuinely one of the worst customer service I have ever experienced, and I've had to deal with EA's support.
Twitter,2019-07-28T10:47:11+00:00,1,Rubbish app,wouldn’t ever use it again!Also love how a bunch of reviews i seen on here a few days back are suddenly gone?
Twitter,2019-07-24T16:13:13+00:00,1,The new layout is completely useless, instead of listening to customers they've decided, once again, to redesign the whole thing and make things worse for everyone.  As a business owner the, now, lack of functionality and visibility is affecting my online presence.
Twitter,2019-07-24T06:40:40+00:00,1,The abusive behavior of some users is out of control. Twitter encourages the behavior unless you are a conservative then you aren't even permitted to say someone was being ugly without them dropping a suspension. I'm sure a class action lawsuit is on the way. Do not expect good service.
Twitter,2019-07-22T20:49:26+00:00,1,Have reached out to support on every platform possible (Tweet, Message, Report, Phone)with a critical and personal issue and every time I am sent a link where I should upload an image to my case I get the error “you are not authorized to upload file to this case.” Support has not taken seriously the nature of this need. This is time sensitive and for over two weeks have yet to be reached out to by an actual person - whether by email or message - and they have been completely negligent to my case, regardless of the many attempts I have made to communicate this issue.So, if you are interested in starting an account with a company with seemingly no one on the other end of the line, feel free to join up.
Twitter,2019-07-20T17:33:18+00:00,5,GreatLove it
Twitter,2019-07-20T12:54:22+00:00,1,I had been a member of Twitter for years and had suffered abuse before for my views. I had previously reported abusers to twitter but they refused to take action then I set up a petition and within 24 hours it had over 2000 signatures and i set up a link for this petition on my twitter page.The petition was on the Care2petition website. Care2petition emailed me to congratulate me and were giving me tips on how to promote my petition. It was also being promoted on their main website front page as a trending petition. Then all of a sudden my petition is removed and my twitter account is suspended. Both care2petition.com and twitter refuse to respond to my emails to ascertain the reasons for the suspension, i am now permanently suspended from twitter which i must say is like a breath of fresh air,no more endless abuse from the morons that frequent that platform. Both of these so called freedom of speech platforms are the opposite of what they are supposed to represent. I will no longer have anything to do with either companies , they only allow freedom of speech if it fits within their own political agenda. I recommend everybody remove themselves from Twitter, i can confirm you will feel a lot less frustrated and happier in your life and hopefully twitter will eventually collapse and disappear for ever.
Twitter,2019-07-20T10:09:25+00:00,1,Twitter has for months limited my account after I prayed for a person who was cursing me out. After that, I was limited even further for asking a person to explain how they came about their facts. This most recent issue, twitter muted me for twelve hours saying that I said one of our Congressional leader's was acting like a bimbo after I caught them lying to the public. Bimbo is not hate speech.Twitter is the new Nazi party. They allow people to send death theats and to verbally say that it is okay to kill people but to Twitter, praying for people and calling a liar a bimbo is too far apparently.
Twitter,2019-07-19T17:24:12+00:00,1,One of the most bias sites out there.  They've allowed libs after multiple warnings from many of us about stalkers, hackers impersonating and breaking into our accounts, doxing us.  Twitter in their ultimate wisdom chose to ignore those complaints and ban all of us for life for reporting a liberal troll with 100's of accounts.  I have all the screen shots and complaints made to twitter with their usual excuse "context maters."  Well saying "you are going to post my IP and names and locations of my family"  seems like there is only one context to take.  Not twitter they said it was ok.  But reporting him was evil.  Go to Gab and use it.
Twitter,2019-07-18T10:08:12+00:00,5,One of the current apps that is always moving in the right direction, only thing I would like to see changed is the £50 minimum promotion fee even though they advertise its $10 or $20!

Twitter,2019-07-11T06:51:03+00:00,1,Twitter is run by Fascist losers with zero understanding of how to run a social media platform. I cannot wait for Twitter to disappear off the face of the Earth ala MySpace. Twitter's true motto is: Protecting child molesters, fascists, white supremacists & other evil people at the expense of common man. Disgusting at best
Twitter,2019-07-09T21:18:43+00:00,1,Twitter is now a leftist outlet working to silence conservative ideals and philosophy.  They allow the leftists to employ profanity and threats while a simple contradictory comment from a conservative gets them suspended.  The have a leftist agenda, censoring those who speak out against it.
Twitter,2019-07-07T09:44:45+00:00,1,loved it untill they took away my account and my freedom of speech... its not right or wrong or freedom of speech anymore... now its who grasses who first. pathetic. f* twitter....the same website thats full of radicalism propaganda on isis is telling me my political views and humor is against there rules!
Twitter,2019-07-06T00:58:48+00:00,1,It's been two weeks now since the "keepers" of Twitter website suspended my Twitter account, accusing me of "multiple violations" of the "Twitter rules".  My Twitter account was at least 4 years old and I almost daily used it to express my political progressive leanings, including: criticizing Donald Trump, the Republican Party and several of Trump's minions; criticizing Israel's long standing brutality and racism enforced by its "Israel Defense Forces" and imposed on its "neighbors", the Palestinians; and criticizing the "leadership" of the Democratic Party.  I have repeatedly filed appeals to learn specifically why my account was suspended.  No response to date from Twitter. Consequently I obviously am the victim of Mark Zuckerburg's politics and his Twitter website which fails to specify which of its rules was "violated" and how and why any of my tweets "violated" the Twitter rules.  Absent much-needed regulation of Zuckerburg and his Twitter website, I must conclude that I surely am not alone as a victim of Zuckerburg's arbitrary and capricious political suspensions!
Twitter,2019-07-02T06:28:19+00:00,1,Blocking conservative accounts are just hypocritical on Twitter's end. It's not Twitter, it's TwitLer.
Twitter,2019-06-26T05:34:17+00:00,4,Wow, didn't really expect so many bad reviews for Twitter! They aren't too bad I don't think. I mean they aren't in my top list of social media apps to use but didn't expect them to have a 1 star on here! Well hopefully this 4 star helps them out some because God knows they need it.
Twitter,2019-06-24T11:08:50+00:00,3,Twitter is decent at best, I certainly do prefer to use Twitter over Facebook, but there are many issues that Twitter has, first of all the fact that they gave their website a very bad new design, and second which in my opinion is the biggest one so far is that you can't state your opinion without some toxic radical SJW coming out of nowhere to shame you for it. Basically, if you're looking for a really chill social media platform, Twitter is certainly not for you, well unless you manage to keep yourself away from those creeps. But in general, Twitter is decent.
Twitter,2019-06-22T15:43:50+00:00,1,Biggest pile of pathetic bias liberal garbage. The 1st amendment only applies to libturds.
Twitter,2019-06-17T17:00:52+00:00,1,Out of curiosity I signed into my Twitter account and guess what?......... Yep, they suspended me again after recently unsuspending me (for the third time) with new allegations this on this occasion of "trying to evade a suspension."How can I be trying to evade a suspension when it was the "notrights" in Twitter-world who unsuspended me?Confused? Yes, so am I.You would think that with staff as stupid as this in Twitter then the Company would implode on itself.Yes Twitter, you still only deserve one star, and that's for your stupidity!
Twitter,2019-06-16T20:27:51+00:00,4,I really love the company, it's absolutely fantastic firm with a lot of things everyone can use in their daily entertainment for everything else to be good. How do you really want them to better? Who are all this people with bad reviews ? Twitter better than FB anyway.
Twitter,2019-06-15T10:13:29+00:00,4,i like a controversial tweet sometimes twice on Sundays
Twitter,2019-06-11T16:32:09+00:00,2,How can you consider a young adult dressed in a military outfit offensive? Are you actually joking and this is a well elaborate troll or is it just plain stupidity, twitter?
Twitter,2019-06-11T04:34:59+00:00,4,Twitter has its pros and cons and it reflects a lot the modern society. On Twitter you are allowed to be yourself or whoever you want to be behind a user, that being said it's easy to find violent people spreading hate on this platform, using it to simply put others down. However, being anonymous allows a lot of people to express their selves freely and harmlessly, which is a mega positive point.I've read some reviews on the political side of Twitter saying that it is strongly right-winged oriented, honestly, you get what you search for. The site is neither a right or left wing box, it is simply a box and looking through it you will find things you want and hate.A few problems with the Twitter algorithm suspending accounts randomly for no apparent reason is quite odd and that reason I took 1 star off this review. There is no clear communication! Sometimes you may have just started a new account and... BAM! It is suspended by no reason and you can't get it back. That truly needs some work.
Twitter,2019-06-10T14:35:07+00:00,1,Very politically motivated.left wing rubbish.endorse fake news.
Twitter,2019-06-05T18:36:16+00:00,1,I read and saw posts from others. I responded initially to some posts in a cordial respectful manner. Some responded back immediately with vulgar comments. They started the ball rolling. So I replied back to the vulgar responses in the same manner. I got a notice of twitter account suspension from what I replied to. I did so in the way some others had started first. If that is twitter's solution, OK. I just made me realize how useless twitter really is and deleted it from my phone. Good thing is I feel better for doing it.
Twitter,2019-06-04T16:46:14+00:00,2,not important or anything...
Twitter,2019-06-03T14:16:25+00:00,1,I have a branded account for my business, and Twitter decided to suspend my account. Not to mention I have a trademark on my brand, licensing, etc to run my platform. Twitter does not investigate FALSE claims and they do not give you to have a FAIR chance to dispute anything (even if it was their mistake). It's basically a lose-lose situation because once it's done, it's done. Their automated process for re-investigating/counterclaims are just bogus - it's all automated OR they just refuse to take the time to investigate their mistakes. Twitter, you need to make some serious steps to helping and protecting business owners and branded accounts b/c competitors are putting in FALSE claims and you are not investigating them properly. Give people a fair chance to solve any issues instead of shutting down their account and ruining their brand.
Twitter,2019-05-21T01:45:59+00:00,1,Like all others who have complained about Twitters ongoing “Suspension” activity against Twitter accounts, I too am a victim of my Twitter account being wrongfully “suspended” for playing the “Follow For A Follow”, “Follow all those who ‘Retweet’ and ‘Like’ “ Posts. I did NOTHING to deserve this treatment by Twitter. I had nothing but GOOD INTENTIONS with my Twitter account. I had over 48,000 Followers over a 10-year period and now “0”! Their CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!! I do not recommend Twitter to new accounts. They can screw with your account too!
Twitter,2019-05-19T23:30:10+00:00,5,I like using Twitter because I am able to tweet out, retweet my own and other people's tweets, like tweets, add/remove a cover photo and do much more. What's not to love? I recommend this social media platform.
Twitter,2019-05-16T06:49:49+00:00,2,so i created an accounti did not set a profile picture or an offensive usernamei didnt tweet or even follow anyonei pretty much didnt really use my new accountcame back weeks later.. to find it suspended!i contacted support saying i had no idea why in the world i was even suspended and they unsuspended my accountnow.. what kind of service suspends you for NO reason, if there was a reason im sure they'd told me, but the fact that they accepted my message about not knowing why i was even suspended.. i think that says alot
Twitter,2019-05-14T22:28:18+00:00,5,I have been on Twitter for a long time. I had some issues with some users like stalkers, but overall I enjoy posting my photos, works, and videos on here. I have not posted my works that much lately because I have been so busy with school and other commitments. However, I will be posting more content now and in the future.  I would recommend everyone to use this website, but be careful what you post on the website though. I also advise everyone to put your copyright information so no one can steal your content.
Twitter,2019-05-14T11:39:30+00:00,2,You'd think with how "big" twitter is, they wouldn't just be another puppet company that only caters to @sskissers that spread the news TWITTER wants you to read. #RealNewsGetCensored
Twitter,2019-05-13T15:19:04+00:00,1,Banning Conservatives viewpoints. Shutting down free speech because they don't agree with it their ideology. Safe space for Fascists. They are dying & I don't even care.#VeryFakeNews Smear Merchants.Communist Propaganda.
Twitter,2019-05-12T08:27:54+00:00,1,None
Twitter,2019-05-10T13:48:31+00:00,2,It almost seems pointless to write this review, because so many other people are clearly feeling frustrated with twitter.Considering so many people are on twitter, it has become a company with no real competitors for short-form communication. Twitter has so much influence on people and politics around the world, perhaps even more than Facebook, considering that Twitter is the chosen platform for most journalists and politicians. It's dangerously powerful at limiting speech and banning people.I think we are at a stage where the US government should get involved and ensure freedom of speech is protected, otherwise twitter and facebook can remove dissenting and critical voices and control the political debate of all nations, in which it operates.
Twitter,2019-05-08T17:51:40+00:00,1,Left wing bias and a complicated mine field of political correctness.  A very difficult site to use for any right leaning person or conservative.
Twitter,2019-05-08T11:45:26+00:00,1,Twitter is despicable in the way that it allows those leaning left to lie and make false claims as in Carl Benjamin's case! He's not even able to refute any claims towards him. This is not fair.
Twitter,2019-05-08T11:08:40+00:00,2,Politically motivated censorship by the organization leads to a silencing of voices of legitimate people.
Twitter,2019-05-08T10:37:13+00:00,1,Left-wing fascist controlled organisation. What more can you say really?
Twitter,2019-05-08T08:43:52+00:00,1,Biased, unfair baning, spreads conspiracy theories and fake science
Twitter,2019-05-08T07:55:33+00:00,1,Twitter is no more than an establishment propaganda machine now. The heavy political censorship this company employs is nothing short of Orwellian. What a disgusting remorseless insidious company.
Twitter,2019-05-08T03:33:54+00:00,1,Corrupt, biased, and partisan. Censorious busy bodies who will suspend you for absolutely anything if you don't have the right point of view. I was once suspended for 'threats' against Leon Trotsky. I was suspended for the letters 'diaf' in a Tweet. I was also suspended for saying Bradley / Chelsea Manning had manfeet. Meanwhile the person who posted Ben Shapiro's home address urging people to drive over there and murder him who was arrested by the FBI is not only unsuspended but his tweet is still there. Twitter will reward criminal behaviour (towards the right people) with a Twitter tick but otherwise ban you for nothing.
Twitter,2019-05-08T03:10:19+00:00,1,These people censor political opinions they don’t like. Unacceptable
Twitter,2019-05-08T02:33:15+00:00,1,Has to be one of the internet's largest echo chamber for the left.
Twitter,2019-05-07T05:46:19+00:00,2,There is no way to remove this stupid web app anymore, and it's pissing me off.
Twitter,2019-04-30T09:56:32+00:00,1,I'm not what you call a social media animal to be honest, and I basically joined twitter for my then girlfriend at the time, because she was like "it will be so great, we can be more imitate with each other." It was a long distance relationship, which turned into a bad twitter romance, as I realized what a domineering, bullying, anti-social, narcissistic pig she was, which led to me airing a lot of dirty laundry on there, which is something I don't normally do, which caused a lot of stress for my mental health, and that's just the start of my gripe with this website.Now, I can't speak about how twitter was 5-8 years ago, but from my perspective in 2018/2019 was that it was/is like a news media outlet website out to spread dread, and negativity, with fascist control over freedom of speech.I'm an opinionated guy, always have been, and I got blocked without an explanation. I asked why they blocked me, they unblocked me a day later, and refused to tell me where the source of the complaint came from. I don't recall saying anything that offensive.Social media has become a deadly poison, that I think it will continue to infect people that religiously use it as the years roll by, and it would affect their well being mentally. Social media makes us feel disconnected from the real world, so we lock all ourselves in this type of fantasy world, as form of escapism, which twitter doesn't really do, as it constantly promotes Brexit and Donald Trump, and other easy targets to bash until you get banned by the twitter police.As for the people who use twitter are a lot of them are fake, shallow people, who are only looking for followers more so than actual communication with each other. I recall this one guy, I think his name was Jon Moses, a singer, I haven't a clue what he actually sings, or what his song style is, but he followed and unfollowed six times in a span of my first two months on twitter, so I end I had to block him, because I think in my opinion he was doing a form of trolling, which I didn't like, one thing I can't stand is attention seeking, drama queens. I had this quite a lot on twitter, people who follow you, expecting a follow back.The final straw for me is when I got blocked by this girl who was talking about mental health, for no reason whatsoever. I followed because I was interested in her mental health posts, she for some reason took a dislike to me, so I got furious so I deleted my twitter account, because I got tired of wasting negative energy on there.So, a summary if you're a self-obsessed selfie queen who likes to take pics in the bathroom with your phone in the air, or you like to take pics of your pasta on a plate with your dirty mouth eating the stuff, then twitter is the place for you. If you like to post things like criticism, positive quotes, artwork or music, then that place is not for you. P.S Don't post pics of Satan that you've drawn yourself on there, they don't like that at all.
Twitter,2019-04-29T21:50:48+00:00,1,Garbage throw back website full of self important narcissists and that's just the people who run it.Horrific standards and practises, exposed multiple times as directly meddling in international politics, silencing political candidates who have not breached their terms of service, silencing views that do not match their own.Mostly frequented by mainstream media, questionable special interest groups (of which we do not need any more in my opinion), terrorist organisations and groups relating to sexual exploitation are all present on their platform without moderation.This is one website which belongs firmly in the history books as soon as is possible, it is absolutely IMHO contributing to the degradation of society at large.
Twitter,2019-04-28T16:21:41+00:00,1,this site sucks as well, not even paying us to waste our time and lifes on this worst site
Twitter,2019-04-26T17:26:01+00:00,1,Sadly Twitter is getting worst as time passes, as they keep hearing the loud minority instead of the bulk of its users. One becomes afraid to post anything at all, as everything is starting be seen as offensive and it will result in a account ban. It is sad to see what social media is becoming, being twitter the one at worst state.
Twitter,2019-04-21T23:01:30+00:00,1,How dare you censor a photo of a young man with a military outfit? How's that offensive? Quitting this platform at once.
Twitter,2019-04-21T11:13:26+00:00,1,They DID NOT listen to me and an entire Twitter Community about Account being locked due to Birthday changes.
Twitter,2019-04-16T02:37:08+00:00,1,It’s been 5 months since twitter said they’d unlock my account due to an error on their end. Super disappointed that every time I try logging on nothing has been done. Wonder if they’ll ever be able to actually help users instead of leaving empty promises.
Twitter,2019-04-11T03:59:50+00:00,1,The platform is operated by tech ppl who part of the Leftist Liberal Resistance. They will scan thru your tweets and purge you. They find you if you have the American flag MAGA in your screen name, or a certain meme as your profile pic. Last year it was Pepe the frog, now it is the pic of the Covington Boy in MAGA. If you text anything at a liberal they disagree, they will claim racism fascism or white supremacy and report you. Twitter will then suspend you automatically. It’s their platform and they are making everyone abide by their social standards and definition of hate speech, abusive language, racism, etc.
Twitter,2019-04-09T13:55:34+00:00,1,Leftist propaganda echo chamber. Openly racist against white people & will ban any account that doesn’t follow their alt-left doctrine. Watch Joe Rogan podcast with Tim Pool & the two Twitter Nazis to see their agenda & hypocrisy exposed.
Twitter,2019-04-04T15:05:01+00:00,3,I enjoy using Twitter (I am not a very active user), mainly for promoting uplifting and helpful ideas, information, businesses, pictures, and words.  I enjoy sharing good things, and Twitter helps me do that a little bit in my small circle of influence on there.I gave Twitter 3 stars because they allow extremely explicit sexual material on their site.  I have had numerous fake accounts (I believe they are robotic or whatever and just follow others' accounts automatically) of sexual natures following me, so I have blocked hundreds of sexually-oriented accounts on Twitter, along with numerous words and phrases, to keep them away!!  If Twitter can better moderate their content, and only allow decent, civil material, then they could get a 5 star review out of me.
Twitter,2019-04-01T06:58:16+00:00,5,Twitter makes it very easy to keep up-to-date with current events and with my friends' lives. Great website/app.
Twitter,2019-04-01T04:42:38+00:00,1,Twitter is engaging in major censorship. It is unconstitutional, illegal & treasonous. Treason is punishable by death in this country. They need to stop these Nazi-like algorithms or face Military Tribunal.
Twitter,2019-03-26T22:10:53+00:00,1,My account has been locked since july of 2018, i submitted a form and was told "the account will be unlocked" it is now march 2019 almost april 2019 and the account is still locked and i cannot seem to reach anyone because they are all robots. poor customer service.
Twitter,2019-03-19T12:38:45+00:00,1,TWITTER CUSTOMER SERVICE IS RUBBISHI have tried setting up a new account using both a previous email and a new email address.I have contacted twitter support and you get the same generic reply which doesnt helpI tried setting up a twitter account on six different computers, laptops, iphones, all with different internet and servers and still unable to set up a twitter account.TWITTER IS WELL PASSED ITS SELL BY DATEWE NEED A BETTER AND UPDATE SOCIAL PROVIDERDONT WASTE YOUR TIME CONTACTING TWITTER SUPPORT AS YOU WONT GET A REPLY THAT IS OF ANY USE.IVE NOT GIVE UP ON SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT
Twitter,2019-03-16T13:54:32+00:00,1,Collusion, Antitrust violations, Freedom of Speech violations. Twitter is crap. I wonder if they're still allowing Samuel L Jackson his hate tweets about white people.
Twitter,2019-03-11T10:06:17+00:00,1,i got suspended from twitter because i used the hashtag #learntocode i sent to a pathetic Irish "journalist" after she posted onto twitter saying that her 8 year old daughter is upset after she heard about global warming for the 1st time. The post went down like a lead balloon, everyone, i mean up to 100 people were telling her she should not put the weight of the world on her childs shoulders. So i said she should #learntocode and i got suspended until i provide more details. What the heck is wrong with learn to code? This is advice, its not insulting. There are people using hate speech towards white men who do not get suspended. Twitter is a liberal tool and nobody should use is as its only one sided, like the other major social networks.
Twitter,2019-03-05T01:06:13+00:00,1,Just know that if you create an account twitter will harass you by falsely claiming you’re “harassing people, silencing users of their beliefs and falling into the line of abusing others” well all you do is tweet regular things. I don’t have a political account or anything along those lines. My twitter account is for my boutique so I mainly share fashion related tweets, or “relevant” tweets, (example: “I never realized how much I took advantage of naps as a kid until I became an adult”) and they will suspend your account and their support system is a whole joke. Every time they suspend or lock your account it’s always for another absurd reason. Never have I ever had such problems with a social platform nor do I understand how they haven’t been shut down yet. I imagine it won’t be long.
Twitter,2019-03-04T09:56:34+00:00,5,I use Twitter to keep in touch with friends, but mostly I use Twitter for my customer service needs. What a great way to get ANY AND ALL your customer service needs in one place. 99% of the customer service requirements are here, all in one place. Thank you Twitter, you make Facebook look like a very, very poor 2nd in regard to social media.
Twitter,2019-03-02T13:15:33+00:00,1,Moderation by Twitter staff is a joke and customer service is virtually non-existent.
Twitter,2019-02-23T01:42:29+00:00,1,Absolutely terrible support. No way to talk to an actual human being. Their support page is useless and annoying. If you file a complaint they say it will be AT LEAST a few days before they respond and the reason i need help is on them and shouldnt have happened in the first place.
Twitter,2019-02-19T21:10:14+00:00,1,I've had Twitter accounts suspended by a dedicated trolls fake reports. More recent that same Troll reported my account, my little brothers and my father. My dad and brother did not ever post anything wrong yet Twitter banned their accounts. They both sent appeals and Twitter rejected them saying that they were removed for "using multiple accounts for abusive purposes" yet they neve did no such thing.
Twitter,2019-02-17T18:32:32+00:00,1,I became an avid user of Twitter for 4 years and thoroughly enjoyed my experience and met some new and interesting people along the way. My page was a lovely devoted and positive page . It was not politically driven . However over the years my account had been compromised on a few occasions. When this happened Twitter would ask me to type in my email address . I did so and was able to use my account. Recently a youtubr whom i subscribed to was falsely arrested and she attached a video footage . I -o f course lend my support . Shortly after i received a notification from Twitter advising my account had been compromised from a user or someone not related to Twitter ( possibly the Tennessee Police or a celebrity. However recently my account was compromised again and a code was sent my email address which Microsoft refuse me to have access too. Twitter had been extremely unhelpful , just responded using re-generated emails . They tried to obtain my number which i was not dumb enough to give them as they would only send me around in circles Microsoft who has also been a nasty service at giving me back my hotmail account. I have lost my twitter account for good nowWhere is  someone going to create a rival so that Twitter can lose their franchise and be gone like Friendsreunited? That is the day i pray long and hard for
Twitter,2019-02-16T19:08:01+00:00,1,Registration is always a problem, and it's always Carton.
Twitter,2019-02-15T23:23:00+00:00,1,Worst Tech Support. They dont respond to tickets, messages, mentions and comments. So if you want to have something deleted they wont do it for you
Twitter,2019-02-15T16:58:10+00:00,1,Twitter regularly locks any accounts I make.  Whether i have a phone number or not, they will first force me to verify a phone number by text, then they lock my accounts again, and force me to verify my phone number with a "call me" option only.  The call comes through, i press 1 or 2 to receive the code, and then it hangs up on me.  When i ask their support site for help, they ignore my appeals and requests.  I reported them to the FTC for locking my personal information into my accounts with no way to get to the management or deletion page because the "Call me" screen just pops up over and over again blocking access to my settings.  When i tried to submit another help request, it asks me to log in, and no matter which of my 3 email addresses i use, it logs me into the same single account, proving to me that Twitter is actively spying on the accounts I make from my ipad and then doxxing my phone number to prevent me from having another account that hasn't locked me out yet.  The FTC did nothing except give me a case number while Jagoff Dorsey gets richer by stifling free speech like a fascist.
Twitter,2019-02-15T11:52:12+00:00,5,Twitter, in my opinion is the best social media platform that is available - everyone should tweet!I have been a member for some years now and they are extremely helpful should one come across any kind of abuse - which personally I have really only experienced once and they dealt with it quickly, so it is a safe platform to use.Never put up with any kind of abuse and it is very easy to report anything untoward.I would highly recommend Twitter as is very easy to use and not as complex as other rivals.
Twitter,2019-02-14T01:06:24+00:00,1,Just painful and annoying.Haven't logged in to company account for 4-5 weeks and when logging in - my account has been suspended.Great! Verify with a phone number- enter company phone - not supported- enter my mobile - already linked to another account (my personal account)What the f*&k am I suppsed to do now?FFS this website is run by f*&king buffoons...
Twitter,2019-02-05T17:31:47+00:00,2,Twitter has been censoring alot of posts for no reason, what once used to be a good platform is now terrible.
Twitter,2019-02-01T20:50:37+00:00,1,So there is an escort profile on Twitter for some prostitution hore called  Chelsea Findom. I tried her once, but never again. £50 for an hour with some faux porno ballerina and her oversized vagina? No thanks. Shan't use again.
Twitter,2019-02-01T18:13:46+00:00,1,TWITTER SUCKS! This outfit, in my opinion us totally corrupt!TWITTER thinks they can be the Complainant, prosecutor, Judge & Jury ALL at the SAME TIME.One would almost think they are run by the Canadian Liberal Party of Canada in that THEY want to CONTROL what you Think Say & Post!TWITTER apparently, in my opinion, cannot Stomach the TRUTH!For Example, I have tried to get Canadian Government Officials to answer questions about yet another tax. They do not respond after weeks. I then posted what Twitter considers a "HATEFUL POST" as follows:"So @HonAhmedHussen @cathmckenna @justintrudeau here we are, with no response from these three completely gutless, unaccountable wonders! And our Governor General @GGJuliePayette continues to ignore her Country as well! It is now 2 TWO WEEKS... "BTW, trudeau, hussen,Chrystia, Freeland, Marie Claude Bibeau, omar alghabra & Iqra Khalid are ALL UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE RCMP FOR FUNDING TERRORISM!This POST WAS NOT HATEFUL. IT WAS SIMPLY TELLING THE TRUTH!In any event when I login I get this:"We've temporarily limited some of your account featuresWhat happened?We have determined that this account violated the Twitter Rules. Specifically, for:Violating our rules against hateful conduct.You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease."If telling the TRUTH hurts then they must be in awful pain. They DID NOT temporarily limited some of your account features. The limited all of them!If you hit hit button to Appeal, the site acts like it has no clue what you want to do. Eventually they acknowledge, by email, you asked for an appeal but you NEVER hear from them! They do NOT reply to email, you cannot phone them, you can do NOTHING!IN FACT THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF CANADA, GUTLESS, SPINELESS & UNACCOUNTABLE!TWITTER IN MY OPINION IS TOTALLY CORRUPT!
Twitter,2019-01-29T04:17:00+00:00,1,Twitter is a liberal sight if you are Conservatives don’t waste your time if you breath the wrong way they erase everything  and lock you account permanently erase all your friends so basically unless your liberal it’s useless That’s why TRUMP won because places like a Twitter block his base so people are shock how many people actually support him TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸 FU&K TWITTER
Twitter,2019-01-26T08:08:50+00:00,3,I will give them 3 stars because I use it for business and pleasure and use it properly . My issue with the site is you can make several accounts under the same ip address.. fake accounts AND users can BUY followers to make it look like they have thousands of them when they arnt real.anyone can create an illusion of customers or friends that are not real. They should only allow one account per ip and not allow fake accounts. Also they have some security issues and have sold peoples info. It doesnt bother me much they wont have anything to find but for many people it wouldnt be a safe and productive choice for their business or personal life.
Twitter,2019-01-22T09:08:29+00:00,1,Hello, my main account was locked because they suspect me for "Unusual activity". I didn't do anything violate (including spam, bot and anything political) and I can't access my old email because yahoo deactivated it, so I forced to make new yahoo email. I tried submitted ticket twice but failed because they said that email didn't match to linked account, I gave the real reasons that I am the real account owner. Until today, they responded that can't assist me because didn't verify my account and keep forced me to ask email provider (despite I had already given many evidences which it me mad that I didn't do anything wrong. Then I realized that just using bot to do their job and they're lazy to communicate person to person. I hate you, Twitter. I hope you die for real.
Twitter,2019-01-12T15:06:03+00:00,1,I tweeted news about Yemen and got suspended. I understand twitter is owned by Saudi Arabia but come on.
Twitter,2019-01-11T02:34:45+00:00,1,These folks blocked my account for suspicious activity and it's been a hassle trying to get them to reactivate it. Honestly, just don't bother with them.
Twitter,2019-01-08T00:12:49+00:00,1,In sending many unwanted and annoying promoted ads over many years to many users who have no use for what is being promoted for example a promoted ads for battery and phone services for users in Central American and Kenya sent to users in Australia, a promoted ad for business owners sent to users who don't have a business, a promoted ad for NYU students sent to users who are not even NYU students, promoted ads for users in certain areas like medical sent to users who are not in that area  etc etc etcWhy do Twitter ignore and violated their own promoted ads and tailored users policies they want their own users to follow?And Jack Dorsey, Twitter board and Better Business Bureau sit back and let Twitter get away with this, because money from promoted ads is more important than following policies and they should resign.If there was zero stars, I would give Twitter and Facebook zero stars as Facebook is basically the same, ignoring their policies as money for sponsored ads is more important.
Twitter,2019-01-07T22:45:04+00:00,1,These folks blocked my account without any notice and even have the nerve to claim it was suspicious activity! Can you believe this?
Twitter,2019-01-07T17:19:34+00:00,1,I was recently removed from Twitter due to a response I made on a conservative platform "ingram angle"  You have got to be kidding me!!

Twitter,2019-01-04T23:54:44+00:00,5,The best social media out there beats facebook 100 to 0 they are way more careful with people personal information to me thats worth a lot!
Twitter,2019-01-03T17:22:16+00:00,1,So many bots and stuff running rampant on Twitter and yet you censor actual people over stuff that's not offensive to anyone. Such a disgrace...
Twitter,2018-12-29T07:55:49+00:00,1,Twitter head office ignores customers complaints, this is a terrible company who just don't care, no direct contact telephone numbers to speak to someone to try and resolve complaints.
Twitter,2018-12-28T14:50:44+00:00,2,Why this crap app still listed under social platform? I dislike Twitter a lot. Most of us has issue with them. Privacy is not secured on Twitter. I hate it completely.
Twitter,2018-12-27T17:37:22+00:00,2,Twitter is getting worse comparing to others. It looks like you people stopped working behind the screen. So much of bugs not fixed and login issues and security is the top of my concern. Worst app ever used
Twitter,2018-12-27T17:07:42+00:00,3,Twitter is best among the social messaging app, so easy to use. And no bug issues at all. Feel so much secured work behind the screen is so good best place to find nice people and information too
Twitter,2018-12-22T13:04:16+00:00,1,Twitter has shown a remarkable double standard when it comes to removing actual hate speech from it’s site.chinese obviously can name Uighurs as terrorists and fuckig muslimsand twitter do not think this is  an abusive commentbut when i tweet that chinese are uighur killers, this twitter consider as racial and abusive
Twitter,2018-12-20T01:19:05+00:00,1,Twitter was once a great platform, but now it's run by people who are overzealous and censor everything they see, even if it's not offensive. What a shame..
Twitter,2018-12-14T16:50:13+00:00,1,I gave Twitter a try for my business and I have to say I hate it as much as Facebook.  I feel a bit nauseous every time I visit my Twitter page.  It's basically the online equivalent of a big office party, with as much falseness and utter time-wasting tripe as you could wish for.  The fact that our politicians are now regularly 'Tweeting' says it all: the world is now officially in the toilet.Sorry folks, Twitter is not good evidence to support Darwin's theory of evolution...
Twitter,2018-12-14T13:53:43+00:00,3,Twitter is always user friendly loved using it every single time comparing to other apps twitter is the best by all means can't stop using it even at my busy hours. I recommend all new users to give it a try i bet u would have great fun.
Twitter,2018-12-05T15:27:06+00:00,2,Accounts being randomly blocked is getting really annoying. Suspicious activity for liking a tweet? Really?
Twitter,2018-12-04T06:07:45+00:00,1,Visited the garage on the 2/12/18 to get a puncture repair, tyre had a temporary plug fitted. Waited at the reception desk. The person who was doing the puncture asked me to go with him to the workshop area. Shows me the tyre and states, is that TURNBULLS work when he saw the plug fitted. I said no, i fitted the plug 6 months prior. He runs his fingers through   loose rubber shavings and states the car has been running on its rim and the tyre is dangerous so cant fit a plug. I know the loose shavings came from me when i was repairing the tyre with a plug. The hole has to be roughened up prior to inserting the plug.. I had informed another member of staff to tell the guy working on the tyre (cant call him a fitter) to put 33 pounds pressure in the tyre. I had also said to Andrew that i cant run  a tyre flat, sensors warn me when pressure drops.When i started to reverse  the rear left tyre warning light was on. The car can also tell me tyre pressures. front left which he had checked for leak also had 38 lbs a square inch, rear left had 26 lbs a square inch, not 33lbs as requested. The work and diagnostics was so sub standard that when i got home i blew a tyre up myself and deflated  the other as  the pressure was over excessive and checked all wheel nuts. Overexcessive pressure can cause an accident when cornering as theres  less rubber on the road surface.Incidently i thought i would like to mention that i have worked as a mechanic most of my life and also done mots and furhermore my car only two day prior had just had its mot  which passed. Can only assume there trying to sell extra tyres before xmas. My tyre which was only half worn could have been sold of as a part  worn tyre which is a win win, well for them anyway, not me.. Felt  it was a fairer business when Andrews father had it in the old place. DEFINATELY a bad experience for me. I will repair the tyre myself, another plug should do it. With tyre pressure being to high on the front left made the car dangerous when i left the garage. If the rear tyre was much less than it was (26 lbs) it could have come away from the rim when cornering. How hard is it to blow a tyre up to the correct pressure?UPDATE----Have checked front left tyre and at the previous plug repair,useing a little water located a small leakat plug (bubbles) fitted another plug alongside and rechecked, leak stopped! On rear found a screw nail in tyre, removed screw with pliersand inserted plug, tested with water, no problem, all leaks repaired and pressure maintained. Would advice drivers to purchase a plug repair kit from e bay and a smal electric pump from Home Bargains for a fiver and your independant. Majority of repairs can be done with the wheel on the car. Repairing a puncture is not a difficult (well for most people)
Twitter,2018-12-04T00:11:08+00:00,2,Stop with all the censoring! Pornographic content, i can understand, but harmless stuff makes no sense to be censored, such as people using army uniforms...
Twitter,2018-11-27T23:22:38+00:00,2,Twitter has been censoring alot of things, for completely no reason. They really are becoming just tyrants, not allowing people to post harmless stuff and suspending accounts for no reason.
Twitter,2018-11-26T14:22:31+00:00,2,What was once a great platform has now turned into a hellhole of randomly suspended accounts, bots, censorship and just a straight dictatorship.
Twitter,2018-11-23T21:35:59+00:00,1,I was setting up an account,  I was trying to find a username as all were taken,  They blocked my account as saying unusual activity!! Picking a username on setting up an account is unusual activity?I cannot be bothered with Twitter.
Twitter,2018-11-23T13:47:55+00:00,2,How can these people block accounts for suspicious activity just so randomly? How is liking tweets and retweeting suspicious?
Twitter,2018-11-21T18:14:14+00:00,2,Jack is biased and he is misusing his position to propoganda wrong and anti-social people.He needs.
Twitter,2018-11-21T02:09:40+00:00,1,Twitter keeps censoring content that is hardly offensive. How is anything related to the military offensive? Do you really believe it incites war? Please...
Twitter,2018-11-20T16:56:31+00:00,1,Twitter is a Very Bias Company And I guess care nothing about are Military. I literary posted a picture of my son in his Army uniform and was blocked. I find that very interesting. This is a Horrible organization that is Anti American
Twitter,2018-11-19T14:52:32+00:00,1,Twitter has become a sh1thole, they block accounts randomly for "suspicious activity" and force us to solve captchas for no reason. How is liking a tweet a suspicious activity? Get your stuff together...
Twitter,2018-11-13T18:11:39+00:00,1,Twitter is the worst platform to communicate or share messages. The reasons are simple as they block the innocent users with no reasons.
Twitter,2018-11-13T16:34:36+00:00,2,Tweets getting censored/removed and accounts are getting locked for "suspicious activity" for no reason. Can you sort your stuff out, @ssholes?
Twitter,2018-11-09T17:03:42+00:00,1,I Opened My Account Last Month In October. I Knew What The Rules Were Before I Open My Account. All Of A Sudden They Suspended My Account For Know Reason. There Wasn’t Anything That I Posted Was Against There Violation. They Will Not Respond To Me At All Far As I Care They Can Shove That Blue Bird Up There ...I was “ Warned” About That Site But Thought I Would Give It A Chance. I Want Be Back They Can Go To Hell. I’m Going To Instagram.  TWITTER 🖕🏻
Twitter,2018-11-09T11:58:38+00:00,5,In my view, it is better than facebook. My privacy is more secure on twitter and my overall news feed is more  oriented to my personal interests.
Twitter,2018-11-08T08:49:32+00:00,1,Why is it even exist? Too many accounts suspended issues with no legitimate reason. I hate twitter a lot. Lost access to my account.
Twitter,2018-11-07T18:50:37+00:00,2,There is a lot of dishonesty and outright lying by politicians on Twitter, catering, apparently, to a very naive audience or just plain old empty headed users.  If your liberal and you insult, even very rudely, you seemingly get away with it.  but if your center right and call out these people in rather brisk fashion you will be cut off immediately, initially for 11 hours.There is a problem with free speech here with the exchange of ideas and different viewpoints and making counter points, holding others accountable on cause and effect...rather passionately.  Its all very boring and they are losing their luster.  They clearly need Government intervention to be called out and exposed with avenues to keep their performance under continuous review.
Twitter,2018-11-07T15:39:50+00:00,1,Twitter purposely suspended me on my account  because I followed my survey jobs on twitter and answered the survey codes like my panel asked me. I get an lying email on support saying they will help me get my account back and lied. they have no intention of ever giving it back to me!!  they cost me  major income I have to do more survey panels to make up for this awful site doing so.  if you make an honest living this app is not for you!!
Twitter,2018-11-01T20:25:44+00:00,1,Worst app and do not ever try it. they keep spending without a reason.
Twitter,2018-10-31T04:40:40+00:00,2,These douchebags keep blocking accounts randomly, you make even the slightest mistake and they block you, spazz.
Twitter,2018-10-31T01:26:17+00:00,3,Twitter is not bad but it's not good either!But for now you've done me so well, and I really like it.
Twitter,2018-10-26T20:39:29+00:00,1,Twitter began randomly blocking people a few weeks back and it hasn't stopped it looks to me as if they only block republicans if you're a Republican and somebody tweets to you and says something derogatory and you reply you will be blocked so democrats are allowed to call you all kinds derogatory names It starts with moron and it works its way up And if you reply to stick up your for yourself or Our president Donald J trump in any way Twitter will block you.Twitter is censoring republicans no doubt about it they are blocking freedom of speech of republicans all it is is censorship.
Twitter,2018-10-16T17:17:01+00:00,1,Awful customer service. Locked thousands of accounts out MONTHS ago and hasn’t made any effort to update us or even ACKNOWLEDGE that they notice the issue. Not responsive, posting stupid updates of a bunch of other crap but not the real issues with locking accounts. Get your act together twitter or I’ll be reporting you.
Twitter,2018-10-14T11:03:44+00:00,3,The reason I took 1 star off is because it's crazy hard to get verified and the reason for the 2nd stars removal is because of the censorship in place.
Twitter,2018-10-13T09:03:19+00:00,1,The current state of Twitter in 2018 just goes to show that the current people running it clearly don't know how to fix their report system that is easy to abuse and don't seem to have at least One Single Person with brains behind Twitter Support. People have been permanently suspended / IP banned off of Twitter by arrogant and selfish users that can easily abuse their broken report system. I've been one of many victims of the broken reporting and account suspending system and support did nothing but send it's automated replies back saying that I won't be unsuspended for the usual completely false reasons.The platform is falling apart and if Twitter don't get their act together and improve the site's reporting system, support page and get their act together on how they manage account suspensions then the site will slowly but surely end up just like the current state of Facebook in 2018.
Twitter,2018-10-12T17:18:28+00:00,5,Twitter is the best place to highlight the issues. I love the platform it reaches every day. I would be happy if twitter increase the number letters in a post. I enjoyed using twitter.

Twitter,2018-10-06T20:12:20+00:00,1,Locked my account and forcing me to reset password through an old email which I have no access to. No other options given to "prove" I am the owner. Why would I lie about an account that I made private and only has 400 followers which I have used for six years? What would be the motivation for me to lie and gain access to such a small account that is not mine? Disgusting horrible company.
Twitter,2018-10-05T21:46:01+00:00,2,Good web experience, however their support services are abysmal and have failed to help me resolve an issue regarding my account. You cannot email their support and the support twitter account is a bot that tells you the same things you are able to access on the internet. I cannot call twitter as I live in the UK and this would amount to large bills as they do not have a UK number. I have NEVER experienced such useless customer services and feel at a loss of what to do because twitter have not been helpful and I am devastated at the thought of losing my account.
Twitter,2018-10-03T07:13:43+00:00,4,Easy to get answer if any company not response properly on Email :)
Twitter,2018-10-02T15:13:41+00:00,1,They suspended my account "for multiple violations", no information was given on what violations I have done. I have not used that account for years. Could not even log out of the account because I was stuck in an endless "Consent flow" loop - clicking OK would just open the same error message again and again. I could only get around the problem through password change using a different computer. Support was horrible, cold language, no information given on what specifically lead to account suspension and whether my account was hacked. They closed the support ticket before my response so I could not send subsequent messages.
Twitter,2018-09-05T17:18:52+00:00,1,Twitter support doesn't read tickets but simply sends automated responses back. I'd imagine it's clear offshoring and lack of customer service. I had an active account suspended due to a bogus reason that I had "multiple accounts intended for abuse". I tried reaching out and showing them that those accounts were NOT intended for abuse and were used separately for different purposes, but I kept getting the same automated response. Until they decided with another automated response to not monitor my support tickets after many appeals. When my main account is clearly a legit account with many followers and I was clearly following all the rules and regulations for a long time.Aside from that, Twitter forces phone number verification and locks your accounts out on purpose. I believe Twitter is dying slowly and doesn't have a future. There's many alternative websites that one could use that offer better services and respect their users and their privacy more.
Twitter,2018-08-30T05:43:57+00:00,1,This company is part of the social change of the left. Twitter routinely censors voices that are in opposition.Twitter is the worst of the social offenders.Twitter should be regulated. I have asked my congressman and both senators to rein in twitters more hateful actions against Americans.
Twitter,2018-08-21T17:05:47+00:00,5,Does anyone still go anywhere else to get up to date with the world?
Twitter,2018-08-19T17:54:29+00:00,2,Twitter should go ahead and sell-out to whichever corporation wants to buy it. In a way there's no avenue out of the dim future ahead, where it can't really make enough money for its shareholders.
Twitter,2018-08-04T13:33:33+00:00,4,Hello, I am Madhusudan Somani, founder of MSS Articles.I like twitter but the only thing I don't like is it's "in case you missed it".So I have given 4 start rating.Moreover I have also written a article about Twitter Review.You can read in my blog - "MSS Articles"
Twitter,2018-07-30T02:13:42+00:00,1,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE, my account has been suspended for almost a month. I’ve been trying to reactivate my account (I made my account when I was younger than 13, which is especially annoying because i am currently 18 years old)  and I have not been able to reach or contact any supervisors..... If you ask me this very unprofessional and dissatisfies me as a customer. As a customer, I feel unimportant. Reactivate my account please. @CallieScigliano
Twitter,2018-07-28T16:45:34+00:00,5,I have recently joined Twitter and I absolutely love it. The interface looks fantastic on both the desktop and mobile versions (I haven't seen the other versions however I'd think they are superb aswell). You can share your life with the whole nation and interact with plenty of incredible and quite interesting people. I can also keep myself up to date with the news and weather updates too. I would recommend Twitter to everyone!
Twitter,2018-07-28T12:43:30+00:00,3,Twitter needs to evolve from where it has been sitting for more than a decade.
Twitter,2018-07-25T10:59:12+00:00,1,Apparently I have been acting suspicious by following ArianaGrande and my cousin and I have not even done anything but that, now Twitter won’t let me log back into my account and expected me to pay for a call to verify my number when I didn't even sign up with my number.
Twitter,2018-07-23T20:38:47+00:00,2,Twitter is biased and censors conservative free speech. Twitter is just another cheerleading squad for the DNC and socialists. Twitter hates conservative values!
Twitter,2018-07-20T17:26:23+00:00,2,I've been on twitter for so many years, made new friends on there and met them. It's a great way of communicating and meeting people. However, I recently put my birthday in and they locked my twitter account because I was "underaged" when I first made my twitter account. Utter bullcrap considering I'm well overage to use it. At the time there was no strict age restrictings on using twitter. I had to get 'parental consent' and had to take pictures of mine and my mums identity (birth certificate, passport, driving license) and I get an email saying they're unable to unlock it. Are you joking me? there's enough proof that's my mother and we're related. Utter joke, twitter needs to sort this out because I'm overage to use it and I want my account back. Its embarrassing I have to take pictures of our identity just to say I had parental consent back then when I was underage.
Twitter,2018-07-18T16:09:38+00:00,1,I thought I'd try and use Twitter Ads. As usual in their American way they say 'Hey, it's really simple to set up..' NO IT ISN'T! I was prompted to enter my credit card details and then it said 'Hey please wait while your account is being set up'. So I checked and I saw they'd decided I was going to spend £79 a month. I couldn't change it, I couldn't do anything.And how do these people get away with not having a contact phone number ANYWHERE!? It says 'Hey (they always say 'Hey') do you need help with billing? You click YES and they then say 'Is your question about  X, Y, or Z' And you say 'Y' and then they say is your question about and then they say and then you give up!They don't even have an email address, an online form - nothing. All they have is some kind of thing to tweet to something or other. How they get away with having NO PHONE NUMBER I don't know. I thought the Great God Google penalised companies without a contact number? Or is that just small companies that don't pay em money?
Twitter,2018-07-16T02:14:52+00:00,3,Twitter is kind of boring, and it is sad that they don't make previously claimed handles available, even after years and years of not posting.
Twitter,2018-07-13T16:21:11+00:00,1,Very poor....I am human and during the sign-up, twitter thinks I am Bot and blocks everything.Very poor twitter - loosing millions of new users.Especially now where many people leave FB !!!
Twitter,2018-07-11T02:53:35+00:00,3,Twitter is great! I've been waiting for the "edit tweet" option for 8 years though.
Twitter,2018-07-04T17:50:43+00:00,5,I have used Twitter a lot over these past few years and have thoroughly enjoyed my time on here. The features are great, the mobile app and desktop site is amazing and the whole platform is just incredible! Twitter is amongst one of the best social media platforms out there to date. Very happy!
Twitter,2018-07-03T18:02:55+00:00,1,I attempted to sign up for twitter for the first time and it tells me my account is suspended? WHAT? HOW? I've never been  a twitter user. I guess that is my sign that I don't need this in my life. Should have taken a friends advice and not wasted my time.
Twitter,2018-06-22T05:55:27+00:00,3,Like a diary but people can read it also have opinion's on other peoples comments.  Not a great fan of twitter a bit boring like instagram. Suppose if your a stalker like spying on other people's business then its ok! Or interested in what people think or done.
Twitter,2018-06-20T08:01:34+00:00,5,Twitter is best social platform then Facebook ..
Twitter,2018-06-16T19:00:23+00:00,2,This would be a great social media site but without proper moderation it's a troll haven, if I had not built up a network of friends on there I would delete my account in an instant.

I joined a three months ago and now can not wait to delete my account....What is going on in there is a completely horrible,online wars between people with a different opinions. Its open ethnic wars between countries im serious ! I would like to follow my favourite actor or actress for example but still people attacking each other in a comments, attacking actors ,writers and on....Agh forgot to mention. Its open crime online and they don't do anything about it even after you reported it to them ! Like a fake accounts pretends to be a charities and they accounts still on twitter !Every time im on twitter I feel like to go to shower after it !Good buy twitter !
Twitter,2018-06-04T04:48:53+00:00,1,They are shadow banning accounts that don't meet their own criteria to be shadow banned - a ban where you don't realise no one can see your tweets.Reversing this process is a pain and doesn't stop it happening again. I am not a spammer, a troll and I do not post excessively, so why the ban. Creating a new account doesn't either. I've given up. Moving on from Twitter.

Twitter,2018-05-08T07:13:16+00:00,5,An entertaining app that helped me make plenty of new friends
Twitter,2018-04-21T16:44:47+00:00,2,Twitter used to be my favorite social media but it's getting boring. The platform doesn't change and it barely is updated. They need to innovate, not to mention how toxic the community is. Twitter Team keeps banning people for no reasons.
Twitter,2018-04-13T23:32:22+00:00,5,Honestly say that you are good at sending consignments, packages with the products we order. Sometimes this is fine and comes quickly as you write, but once in a mail, you can keep the duty somewhat longer because it is a suspicion of bad stuff. You are good at something less cost, faster to come and take it with you. I recommended to your company's friends  and MiniInTheBox.com, because you are good and you have a lot of things to do with us, but we can not go all the way across the border - the big deal is expensive. With regards to Miroslav
Twitter,2018-04-09T12:15:22+00:00,2,I have a Christian Twitter account and I've been shadow banned for two-years now. Despite hundreds of followers and daily updates to the tune of 28 thousand tweets, very few people ever see my posts. I only keep tweeting to show Twitter's immature censorship happy employees that I won't cave to their cyber bullying.
Twitter,2018-04-08T03:33:13+00:00,4,I like the simplicity of Twitter, but only as long as I'm using it in an app like TweetBot. I wish the web app had a light version; just the timeline.

It is constantly updating every second. People are posting stuff right now... more than 50,000 people are posting to Twitter because that's just how it is. It is highly impossible for you to ever miss out on anything because Twitter is always awake!  It is a 24/7 running website and it's the heart of social media.There is a 99.99% chance that you have way more Twitter notifications that Email notifications..Check.

Twitter,2018-02-16T08:02:13+00:00,1,When I first joined Twitter Obama was their hero and most Tweets backed him. I was okay with that because I figured I could express my opinion too. I was wrong. Twitter shadow deleted all my posts, so I very rarely got likes or retweets. Now the Pendulum has swung to Trump and everybody is backing him. Well, not really but that's all Twitter will allow. This is a total disgrace to the first amendment and Twitter just follows the money.
Twitter,2018-02-08T16:29:14+00:00,1,I've only just joined a minute later I got locked out  and I don't have a mobile number so I can't back in. Not happy so won't be bothering again...how can you get locked out a minute after you joined :-/
Twitter,2018-01-26T08:05:36+00:00,3,Like the idea, but the platform is so hard to maintain
Twitter,2018-01-25T20:41:18+00:00,3,It tries but like many other people have stated, it censors random things far too much but let's other things slide so the inconsistency just makes for a pretty scrambled website. It used to be something that people used to share everything about their day but now it feels like something that is just used for political rants. Sure, twitter doesn't really decide what goes on their website so I agree that it isn't their fault but I am rating this website while including the community that is there as well. I just wish they would allow for free speech more or limit it on all levels on both sides of politics.
Twitter,2018-01-24T11:42:48+00:00,1,Such a bad service - promotes low intelligence celebrity culture for maximum profit - but restricts or bans informed opinion that it doesn't like.
Twitter,2018-01-10T10:15:16+00:00,1,Total waste of time unless you are a Liberal Left winger who want to be in an echo chamber full of like minded people. Any viewpoint slightly right of far left results in your account being suspended for "hate speech".I had a profile picture of a snowflake being melted and that was deemed "expressing hate towards a protected category" i.e. snowflake people are a protected category, and my account was suspended after just 2 weeks.Twitter has never made a profit and it is easy to see why. Why would any company advertise on their platform when your potential customers could be banned at a drop of a hat.
Twitter,2018-01-08T17:51:03+00:00,1,Twitter says that it will respect your privacy and not release personal information.  So, you can imagine my surprise when I saw my name posted on a Thread where people said that they were now going to doxx me.  That's when I decided to cancel my account and let my friends know.  Shame on Twitter for violating one of its policies that it holds sacred.
Twitter,2017-12-30T16:09:49+00:00,3,Good, hardly any adverts, but there is a lot of spam bots.
Twitter,2017-12-18T23:18:16+00:00,1,Joke of a platform designed only for those that agree with the politically correct statements of the day. Best avoid if you have your own thoughts and ideas. Support will harass you if you have a conservative view point - but allow terrorism, racism and Antisemitism on their platform.
Twitter,2017-12-07T16:12:57+00:00,3,Good & bad. There are some lovely people on twitter, but sadly there seems to be more & more trolls & bullies popping up these days, which makes it a less pleasant experience.
Twitter,2017-12-06T22:21:25+00:00,5,Twitter let me tweet, that's for sure. Sometimes I feel lonely like in the dark forest but sometimes my tweets fly fuuuuuurther.

Twitter,2017-11-05T10:54:53+00:00,3,The platform is good but they need to do something about all these racist accounts pedophile account and others behavior like that. It takes a long time to take them dowm it's not normal.

Twitter,2017-08-25T01:04:55+00:00,1,Made an account, set up the profile and moments later..."Your account has been locked.""What happened?Your account appears to have exhibited automated behavior that violates the Twitter Rules."What a great service, making an account is against the rules.
Twitter,2017-08-21T15:27:02+00:00,1,Customer Service is Horrible,Locks your account and gives you the option of proving your not a bot by entering your phone number and they will call with a code. Here's the thing, you won't get a call and your account will stay locked until they get around to it. Avoid giving them AD money......
Twitter,2017-08-19T00:04:16+00:00,1,This company is the pits! All that I wanted to do, with some urgency, was to get on Twitter to make sure that my nephew was safe since he was in Barcelona at the time of the terrorist attack. However, I was consistently blocked from accessing his team's Twitter account via Google, so I attempted to set up a Twitter account for myself (figuring that I would no longer be blocked). 'Got to a step in which I entered my phone # and was called with a code. Kept entering the code but, each time, I got an error message (although I was very careful to enter the correct code). Now I get a different error message that I've exceeded the number of permissible attempts, and I still can't get on Twitter. Tried to contact Customer Service but there's no phone help and the on-line help system is Byzantine, at best. It'll take me all night to wade through it and, I suspect, it still won't resolve my problem. Thanks, Twitter, for helping me to find my nephew after a terrorist attack. Now I just want to delete the account.

Twitter has been a key piece to the freedom fight in the Venezuela post-Chavez

Twitter,2017-07-27T10:46:41+00:00,5,I like twitter. It's main function is to assist in the promotion of businesses around the world and they've done an excellent job at it. They've helped me a lot with promoting my youtube channel.
Twitter,2017-07-14T19:04:25+00:00,1,I have a business and would like to grow membership by using Twitter.  They send me "twitter for business" emails to sign up with their service and grow my business.  However, they also send me emails from time to time that I have so many new followers.  I keep track of the followers and when I go onto my twitter account, the follower count is the same.  For every person who follows me, I reciprocate by following them. Yet I have MANY more people I'm following than followers??? (It should be the same number)?I wrote Twitter three times about this but never received an answer back.WHY WOULD I WANT TO SIGN UP AND PAY A FEE WHEN THE MEMBER COUNT HASN'T INCREASED NO MATTER HOW MANY NEW MEMBERS I RECEIVE?
Twitter,2017-07-10T13:47:27+00:00,4,Brilliant app love twitter I always have.Although sometimes freezes up on my phone but other than that,brilliant!
Twitter,2017-07-04T14:49:44+00:00,5,I have found the speed and efficiency with which they seek to resolve difficult situations pleasing and is much appreciated  when circumstances require action from them
Twitter,2017-06-17T07:49:14+00:00,1,They have no response channel to help access or just close down an account when the associated email address is not available. Twitter does not follow their own policy on inactive accounts - even after many years. It doesn't have any complaint mechanism and automated replies on other channels are irritatingly irrelevant and waste of time when a problem would take less than 10 seconds to investigate and solve.
Twitter,2017-06-10T10:07:36+00:00,1,My account has been hacked and email changed but twitter support have been entirely useless saying they are unable to help unless I email them from the email address of the hacker.They are virtually impossible to contact, and then send random copy and paste emails that don't reflect the issue. When you complain they close the support ticket down.

Twitter,2017-04-17T14:47:36+00:00,1,Enough is enough. Twitter was a good site and service back in the day. Meanwhile it's just limitations and verifications everywhere.#1: Why do I need a phone verification to use Twitter? This is an online service. So, could someone explain to me, why sensitive private data not needed for the service is mandatory?#2: Next, with a brand new account, I want to follow a few people. Hitting the first follow, the button changes, a few seconds later the button changes back. Error message: "Sorry, something went wrong". Second day. Same problem still. So, brand new account. Following not possible.#3: LIMITing characters to 140, BUT ...#4: Replying to a first tweet is possible. Replying to a second tweet and offering a link for additional information, since Twitter is a HEADLINE ENGINE, NOT A SOCIAL MEDIUM(!) ... Error message. NOT POSSIBLE!!!#5: Entering a website. Website unacceptable. Here is the clue: just because "fraud" is in the domain name, the website links is "considered malware"!#6: Tweeting one or two links => account suspended. You could be a spammer.Congratulations Twitter! You know how to keep people away from your webiste. This is ridiculous! Do they want people to use the website or do they just want people to provide their private phone number and then leave and never come back again. Because that is what they make me do.So, back to Twitter. Deleting the phone number. And they never see me ever again.
Twitter,2017-04-12T20:50:10+00:00,2,Totally angry with twitter. Notifications, tried three times to stop useless notifications, spam coming to my email account. Third time I switched off all notification. I was still sent spam to my email, untollerable! Wasted lots time trying to stop this rubbish from happening to no avail.

Twitter,2017-03-08T16:51:53.787+00:00,1,Twitters customer service is some of the worst I have experienced. Using their Twitter Ads was difficult with no decent results but apparently because I changed some settings a few times I saw my money just disappear!Twitter support was NO HELP what so ever and just refused a refund and ignored my complaints. Never will I advertise on Twitter again!
Twitter,2017-02-26T20:54:29+00:00,1,NOT ENOUGH CHARACTERS
Twitter,2017-02-24T21:18:33+00:00,3,Even Valve's steam support is better than twitter's current automated support which is so slow and bad, it's almost impossible in some cases to recover your accounts because of this issue.
Twitter,2017-02-20T11:48:18+00:00,5,Twitter is the best!
Twitter,2017-02-10T10:01:50+00:00,5,Complimet Twitter, you created a marvelous site for news and updates of any kind. I hope it will also become a profitable company that rewards its investors as soon as possible!
Twitter,2017-02-06T20:52:54+00:00,5,It is wonderful, I love it...it is possible to discuss with a lot of people and discussions are always amazing; the site never goes down and, instead of Facebook, is much more free
Twitter,2016-12-29T12:50:12+00:00,1,I have been trying for about 3 days to get into my twitter but no joy. I've tried everything even uninstalling app. They keep saying press call me button for a verification code, but no one is calling me back with this code and my number is correct...its so annoying!!!!
Twitter,2016-12-10T12:22:12+00:00,5,After my death I have became very popular on twitter!
Twitter,2016-10-28T17:04:48+00:00,2,I wanted to share my dominoes review on Twitter but it did not work properlytriggered
Twitter,2016-10-28T11:11:25+00:00,1,I have never received any worse customer service as from Twitter. We are trying to get access to a Twitter account. The administrator of this account died last year, and the mail account associated with the Twitter account doesn't exist anymore. Twitter refuses to help get access to the account. They keep saying that we need to e-mail them from the associated mail account but as this mail account is non-existing this is impossible. And they refuse to look at other means of proving ownership. It's no wonder Twitter is not succeeding in making the company profitable.
Twitter,2016-08-25T00:34:54+00:00,4,Based here in the UK, love the new 'moments' section. Far better than fb which is all adverts recently, favourite networking site right now
Twitter,2016-08-16T11:45:01.989+00:00,5,I spend a lot of time on Twitter daily. I just love the interface and the message limit, it really gives off some unique feels. The only thing Twitter needs, is an edit button. Other than that, create an account and start tweeting!
Twitter,2016-04-15T05:43:58+00:00,1,i used to have a twitter account.and i used it to use the cbs sports website during the ncaa tournament.and i had some people harassing me on there putting down my basketball team.they were talking trash.and when i responded i was banned from twitter.the guys who started with me didnt get banned.and i know because i checked their twitter page.so i was upset because twitter obviously was biased here.if they wanna bann me thats fine but they should have banned those other guys too,especially since they started it first.
Twitter,2016-02-14T09:34:42.892+00:00,4,Here i share my experience with all to be a twitter user. This site is very helpful to express your feeling with your fan and all the people...
Twitter,2016-02-03T22:59:29.114+00:00,2,Too much Trump for my liking.
Twitter,2016-01-29T18:31:41+00:00,1,I didn't like it. Never appealed  to me
Twitter,2015-12-30T13:36:12.305+00:00,1,No way to verify you'r account you have to wait until they check after years!!!!!!!
Twitter,2015-12-14T16:19:15+00:00,1,I have been trying to create a twitter profile, but every time it tells me that my email already is in use, thou I have never used twitter before.I request a password reset and received an email in Spanish of which I didn't understand anything. It turns out some other random dude somehow have his twitter account linked to my email.Twitters support page is useless, everything just sends you in circles, and they have nothing about my specific problem. After about two hours I find a box to message twitter and explains my problem, asking them to unbind my email from the other persons account.Response from twitter: Try resetting your password. Totally useless, they apparently didn't even read what I wrote.I write to them a second time and again I receive the same lousy standard "try resetting your password".How can a company like Twitter let someone link another persons email to their account without some sort of verification.
Twitter,2015-11-30T21:43:35.441+00:00,5,The best social network to use.
Twitter,2015-11-27T02:30:50.135+00:00,5,Tweeter is more friendly than facebook. More safe, without spam and scam, lots of interesting tweets and fast communication :)
Twitter,2015-11-01T18:14:20+00:00,1,I try to deactivate my account  but they always reactivate it again and when i try to Get help they say go to support site. But it can not do anything. Maybe i can close my account  This  way
Twitter,2015-09-14T10:08:47.568+00:00,4,If you're into making new connections that share the same interests with you, all you need to do is to write a right hashtag.
Twitter,2015-07-20T09:50:22+00:00,1,How are you! Twitter support team! I could not log in my account , because my account has been blocked. Twitter had sent a confirmation code to my logging-in email addr. but I have never received the email. Please try to help me solve the problem
Twitter,2015-03-23T14:37:12+00:00,5,definitly hot, great company, perfect page, strong buy ! ;-)
Twitter,2015-02-27T23:27:01+00:00,5,This is very different to FB. You can follow celebrities or anyone in particular.
Twitter,2015-02-13T18:33:55+00:00,5,I am using the Twitter to follow all newspapers I want to read. But, not only the newspapers, but also the all media that are not mainstream. This is why Twitter is helpful.
Twitter,2014-12-09T12:31:03+00:00,5,I'm still fairly new at twitter, but it's 100x better thaan facebook. Other than the fact the limit is 140 characters (spaces included), it's a great social media site. 140 characters is plenty for a quick tweet, enough to get your msg out.
Twitter,2014-12-08T07:08:02+00:00,4,The site I use at least 10 times a day.
Twitter,2014-10-30T10:03:27+00:00,5,Twitter's simplicity is what keeps me using it.No annoying ads, no annoying teenagers asking for likes on their pictures and most certainly, no annoying spam comments.Keep up with the good work twitter!
Twitter,2014-10-05T09:23:56+00:00,3,Twitter is the ramblings of delinquent minds
Twitter,2014-09-16T10:09:26+00:00,5,Twitter is a fantastic social media site, although I still don't completely understand it!  Use it to follow all my favourite YouTuber's to see what they are up too and to see if they are doing any live streams.
Twitter,2014-08-29T13:24:26+00:00,5,Twitter is probably the best social media website out there at the moment. It has all the great features that facebook offer, and then has it's own advantages too.It's especially great for keeping up to date with what your favourite celebrity is doing, and if you're lucky, they may even tweet or follow you! This never happens on facebook.The only thing that I dislike about twitter is the tweet limit of 140 characters. While I can sort of see the purpose, I don't think it is necessary.
Twitter,2014-08-07T14:51:47+00:00,5,I love using twitter services.
Twitter,2014-08-03T03:11:30+00:00,5,Not always the best place if you want to avoid trolls but it's really the best place on the internet for news related stories.
Twitter,2014-07-24T12:43:11+00:00,3,I love this website and use it frequently on the phone but hate the desktop version its awful.  Navigating around it is painful.
Twitter,2014-07-01T20:38:13+00:00,5,I have loved twitter for years now, I am totally addicted. Most probably the best social media platform in the world!
Twitter,2014-05-28T02:56:32+00:00,5,I've loved Twitter since the beginning, and have enjoyed posting tweets It's a great Highly recommended!
Twitter,2014-05-03T09:50:43+00:00,5,Twitter is a very important media channel these days... I think every important person should use it.
Twitter,2014-04-10T03:52:09+00:00,5,I've loved Twitter since the beginning, and have enjoyed posting tweets from my own website. It's a great outlet to let out something quick, and share with the twitter sphere. Highly recommended!
Twitter,2014-01-01T07:44:44+00:00,5,Twitter with all its top-notch page rank on the net and popularity, keep on adding suitors and admirers from across the globe on a daily basis. Its a good platform. Have used it and feel ok with it. It has now become an art to express yourself in a few characters on Twitter. Love the concept.
Twitter,2013-12-26T03:23:04+00:00,3,I recently resolved the contradiction between two truths; 1. Merely being on twitter is like great opportunity to claim about different things. 2. Someone is posting tweets or viagra commercial tweets on behalf of me! I dont know whether is a kind of virus or what! But no one but me has acces to my account, I least Im sure that no one can figure my passwors out.It would be just great if you could solve this problem ASAP, since its so annoying that now I almost check my twitter every minute, so I can delete the mentioned tweets as soon as they are post
Twitter,2013-12-21T02:48:13+00:00,1,Man siger, at vi lever i en verden med ytringsfrihed. Desværre er det ikke noget Twitter er helt enig i. Jeg er flere kontakter blandt andet i Brasilien, der har oplevet at blive blokket og direkte ekskluderet på baggrund af, at de åbenlyst har kritiseret den brasilianske regering. Et socialt medie, der ikke tilslutter sig en af de mest demokratiske principper, nemlig ytringsfriheden, bør efter min mening ikke have nogen eksistensberettigelse. Det kan ikke være rigtigt, at man ikke kan dele politiske synspunkter i mellem venner på Twitter, uden at blive blokket!! Det er dybt usmageligt!!>>>>>>You say that we are living in a world with the freedom of speech. Unfortunately that is not something that Twitter agrees with. I have several contacts some of them from Brazil, who have experiences to be blocked and excluded as they openly have criticized the Brazilian government. A social media that does not become affiliated with the ground principles of the freedom to speech should as far as I am concerned not have the right to exist. It’s not right that you cannot share political points of view among friend on Twitter without being blocked!! That is completely distasteful!!
Twitter,2013-09-01T17:06:28+00:00,2,Unless you're a famous person, Twitter is actually useless to the average joe.. no followers, people who pretend to be others on there, its all fake to be honest. i'm on there but find it a chore to find what to type or write about. boring, rather be on FB at least there you know who is on your friends list..
Twitter,2013-07-10T10:45:25+00:00,5,Twitter has changed my life, allowing me to communicate easier, whilst on the move.
Twitter,2013-05-05T23:51:09+00:00,3,Full of spoofs, you never know who is real and who is fake!All the bestFreddie Mercury x
Twitter,2013-03-31T13:46:02+00:00,5,supper awesome og Follo mig via Theis_P
Twitter,2013-01-06T17:10:20+00:00,5,I think that Twitter is the best social network at the moment. Easy to use, good if you want to meet new people, no so much span like facebook.In 140 caracter you can understand so many thinks about somebody, and than is also funny try to write you messages in 140 caracters :)I hope the twitter will never change.
Twitter,2012-10-03T19:06:47+00:00,5,Stalking mode: ON!I love twitter its a good way to get freinds from the hole world :D!kort sagt: det er dejlig!
Twitter,2012-09-20T18:55:24+00:00,5,I use twitter on a daily basis and I love it!It's easy to use and best of all, it doesn't cost you a single penny.It's a great way to connect with people from all over the world.
Twitter,2012-09-18T03:09:28+00:00,1,I dont get it,tomany people have to much time on there hands.People tweet about nothing at all and people still follow them? Am i missing something?
Twitter,2012-09-06T13:59:38+00:00,4,The thing I really like about Twitter is that it makes you think every time you are posting a clever thought - manage to squeeze into those 130 characters. But in the rest, well, judging by the content - apart from knowing what a person has just done there is nothing else much.
Twitter,2012-09-03T12:11:29+00:00,3,Doesn't seem useful to me and when I had an account there I had troubles writing those short messages. Not useful to me, sorry, but I like the logo alot. :-)
Twitter,2012-08-08T19:36:53+00:00,5,Twitter is very convenient and fast way of communication. Simply awesome.
Twitter,2012-08-05T18:05:06+00:00,1,As far as superficial community networks are concerned, Facebook is enough... 140-character twitts are not my cup of tea.
Twitter,2012-07-27T09:59:21+00:00,5,You either "get" Twitter or you don't and it looks to me that most of the people reviewing it here "do not get it"! Twitter is not a standard "have a good birthday" or "look at this funny picture of me" social network.Twitter is a stream of consciousness. A window in time onto the views of the world. It's a great place to read some very witty remarks - I sometime laugh out loud at my desk reading the answers to some trending topics. It's also a great place to get update on the news quickly. It's not all perfect, but if you can sort the wheat from the chaff you can get little gems very early!If you "get it" then Twitter is just the best!
Twitter,2012-07-26T18:15:43+00:00,3,I avoid this social network. Tried to use it but it just don't suit me.
Twitter,2012-07-24T20:32:58+00:00,2,I don't like the concept of Twitter and will probably never going to use it.
Twitter,2012-07-24T19:41:49+00:00,5,I often use twitter to follow some interesting personalities and topics. Very useful to keep yourself informed about things.
Twitter,2012-07-23T17:08:14+00:00,5,I twitt regularly and have a good base of people that I also follow. Nice and simple way to keep in touch, kinda like text messaging
Twitter,2012-07-21T22:31:55+00:00,2,Twitter is just not my cup of tea,
Twitter,2012-07-19T04:00:53+00:00,1,for shitty kid
Twitter,2012-07-16T18:45:00+00:00,5,I love twitter you can catch up with all the latest gossip and celebs.
Twitter,2012-07-15T15:18:08+00:00,1,I don't understand how people can communicate within 140 characters as a norm?! I guess it's enough for those on Twitter..
Twitter,2012-07-14T16:52:19+00:00,5,I like Twitter because of the 140 characters limit because it forces you to think before you blink.I have seen events sell out in 20 minutes due to social engagement because of how FAST Twitter delivers messages.
Twitter,2012-07-05T20:05:00+00:00,4,While I love the website itself, they doesn't seem to like it when you use third party tools to delete all your tweets.. This makes it look like they want to keep the data, even after you delete your account.
Twitter,2012-06-21T05:50:02+00:00,5,Great place to connect with everyone!
Twitter,2012-06-18T19:42:28+00:00,1,One-sentence communication. If you happen to have something to say that is longer than 140 characters, well you're out of luck here.
Twitter,2012-06-18T17:47:45+00:00,5,Recent twitter convert - one of the best decisions. Such a good way to avoid long rants
Twitter,2012-06-12T13:45:44+00:00,5,it has taken me 3 years but i have finally got the hang of twitter. but now it is a worldwide success, a lot of my friends are only just starting to use it and dont know how! it can be very confusing to start with which doesnt make you want to continue using it. i have finally got the hang of it and i love it! i can freely vent how i am feeling!
Twitter,2012-06-04T03:16:06+00:00,5,Simple and convenient way of communication! Kudos to whomever invented it!
Twitter,2012-05-29T16:29:04+00:00,5,Perfect job and very great website and i love twitter! Cheers
Twitter,2012-05-23T10:33:25+00:00,4,i like twitter because it have good tools and most of my friend are using it ........
Twitter,2012-05-14T21:31:30+00:00,5,I use this more than facebook these days
Twitter,2012-05-07T19:44:01+00:00,4,nice idea for 140 char
Twitter,2012-05-02T22:00:23+00:00,2,To me twitter is just like a big news and gossip website, in which everybody gets to find out what other people (famous or not), organizations, TV shows, etc. do. It's just like texting, you can just write 160 characters as your status? Or maybe a picture? Really? That's why you also have a Facebook, with FB you can do all of that already, and follow people too. Twitter doesn't surprise me, is just like any other simple social media website. Thank you.
Twitter,2012-05-01T15:21:44+00:00,4,this is a good way to keep track of entertainment and people
Twitter,2012-04-27T20:52:19+00:00,2,I don't know why, but I find its oversimplified way of communication repulsive.
Twitter,2012-04-21T18:51:56+00:00,5,Makes keeping up to date with what your favourite celebrity is up to, what your friends are doing and what's happening in the world.
Twitter,2012-04-18T21:05:34+00:00,1,Dont people write some rubbish on this. Staying away. Write reviews instead, its more fun.
Twitter,2012-04-17T10:01:23+00:00,5,I like sports, like polo shirts, sale-polo-shirts.com polo shirts is very beautiful, very cheap, quality is also very good, I very like website.
Twitter,2012-04-15T17:23:39+00:00,1,I hate it. It is too confusing and too brief for my taste. I think it is getting people dumber. “How to express myself in as shorter sentence as possible?”  Duh…
Twitter,2012-04-13T16:25:14+00:00,5,like it more and more
Twitter,2012-04-12T13:42:12+00:00,4,Twitter is a great platform, however, to often having regrets about following someone... sometimes people share to much!
Twitter,2012-04-07T19:14:59+00:00,5,Love twitter
Twitter,2012-03-29T23:07:26+00:00,4,None
Twitter,2012-03-29T06:58:12+00:00,4,Quite helpful for everone
Twitter,2012-03-27T12:38:09+00:00,3,They have problem with the site sometimes. Cannot post links, etc.. But so far so good
Twitter,2012-03-25T16:09:46+00:00,1,I don't use social networks.Useless for me.
Twitter,2012-03-23T17:59:48+00:00,5,I read tweets and it passes the time
Twitter,2012-03-23T05:48:42+00:00,1,Why bother
Twitter,2012-03-22T15:26:30+00:00,3,I signed up a while back, and occasionally check it out, but if you don't spend all day on Twitter, you can do everything on it on Facebook. Only a certain kind of person really needs Twitter.
Twitter,2012-03-20T22:39:22+00:00,1,Nothing good to say about it - really hate this site.
Twitter,2012-03-20T11:28:35+00:00,5,If you're not on twitter, you need to be - it's much better tahn facebook.Give it a try!
Twitter,2012-03-17T20:44:13+00:00,1,Seriously, I've never known a website that was as big of these two things in the world.
Twitter,2012-03-15T13:17:48+00:00,5,Twitter is incredible! So simple, yet so effective!
Twitter,2012-03-13T19:38:46+00:00,4,stalking my fav celebrity feels and great but whats more great is.. its international!! not just hollywood .... i feel closer to them and the update is real time, speed is quick!!
Twitter,2012-03-13T17:53:20+00:00,3,Would reccomend it to my friends any time:-)
Twitter,2012-03-11T04:07:29+00:00,1,I really don't care what you're doing or what your ignorant opinions are.

Twitter,2012-03-06T00:55:33+00:00,3,I just don't know about this tweet thing, seems a bit too short.
Twitter,2012-02-27T19:08:18+00:00,5,you can follow the world
Twitter,2012-02-27T14:35:32+00:00,5,a great way to keep in touch
Twitter,2012-02-25T14:33:32+00:00,1,Quite overrated and not that great
Twitter,2012-02-23T20:30:04+00:00,1,I got hacked almost immediately and really isn't there something better to be doing them announcing what mundane activity you're doing now. Get a life!!
Twitter,2012-02-23T20:03:34+00:00,2,I have no idea what is wrong with twitter, but every few months they feel compelled to change their format.Some one needs to tell them that enough is enough...
Twitter,2012-02-17T04:38:56+00:00,5,I truly didn't think it would happen to me... But I can live without my twitter.
Twitter,2012-02-16T16:32:06+00:00,5,Thank you for your social network: it is so much more interesting and less "spying" than Facebook!
Twitter,2012-02-14T19:28:54+00:00,4,Way to keep in touch and stay updated about the world and ppl you're following. Even the mobile apps work like a charm. On the con side it can be a little confusing for beginners, and has a little hard to get used to, but other than that good.
Twitter,2012-02-13T16:28:47+00:00,4,I don't use Twitter a lot but I like it.  Works effectively.
Twitter,2012-02-08T19:51:22+00:00,2,Twitter is loved by many.  Not me.  I just can't find my way round it properly - I obviously need a training course!Also, services like BBC News are posting up so much information that it's overwhelming, especially if you're also getting feeds from other prolific tweeters.I think I'll leave Twitter to those that have more time on their hands than me!
Twitter,2012-02-07T23:28:29+00:00,1,I don't get it
Twitter,2012-02-03T18:55:29+00:00,3,Its alright, I keep in contact with co workers friends and family. What more do you want :)
Twitter,2012-02-02T12:20:17+00:00,5,with just 140 letter is are able to say it. Give it a try.
Twitter,2012-01-30T14:02:09+00:00,1,JUST NO!!!!!!
Twitter,2012-01-29T20:42:28+00:00,5,I never used to like Twitter, until Battlefield started using it for Battlefield 3. Wow, it gives such a good feeling to know the developers are actually responding to your feedback, not just putting it in a giant pile of "this works" and "this doesn't".Twitter is great, its small, fast, easy to use and just generally a brilliant idea!Thanks Twitter!
Twitter,2012-01-26T15:16:42+00:00,5,I love it, It really is good fun and always interesting.
Twitter,2012-01-24T15:02:09+00:00,3,As a big fan of Facebook, myself - I personally rarely use Twitter. If ever, just to keep up with my favourite bands and other celebrities.
Twitter,2012-01-13T13:16:50+00:00,2,I like the idea of Twitter, but don't bother trying to contact them if you have a complaint or problem - they don't answer you and then eventually send an email saying they haven't heard any more from you so they're closing the case!!!Concept = 5 starsCustomer service = 0 stars
Twitter,2012-01-12T22:12:08+00:00,1,Is your life richer by knowing Zoe is stroking her cat, if your life really is that empty and you can't wait the three minutes until Jeremy Kyle is on again for god's sake do us all a favour and take a hot bath with a nice sharp kitchen knife.Look at the first four words and ask do you really want to be one?
Twitter,2012-01-12T20:11:49+00:00,5,I love twitter, it's easy to use and fun.
Twitter,2012-01-02T13:33:35+00:00,5,excellent and easy way to communicate
Twitter,2011-12-27T14:50:27+00:00,5,Twitter is my favourite all time Social Tool.
Twitter,2011-12-19T05:10:11+00:00,3,If you want to no what color pants Steven Fry has put on today, this one is for you, I myself dont want everyone out there being told what I am doing, good if your that lonely bored or cant talk to someone in the real world....

Twitter,2011-12-13T16:34:57+00:00,1,why would i want to know what everyone is doing every minute of there life
Twitter,2011-12-12T18:03:25+00:00,5,Fast and efficient!
Twitter,2011-12-12T07:33:00+00:00,5,like this for a quick look at what is happening in the celebrity world
Twitter,2011-12-10T08:09:38+00:00,4,Love what I love, love twitter.
Twitter,2011-12-08T07:07:45+00:00,5,5 stars is a great ranking.
Twitter,2011-12-02T13:32:08+00:00,4,i started Twitter back in April but only started to get into it two months ago. Twitter it a great way to express your personality but sharing inspirational tweets.It is a really fun way to pass the time and a good way to get all the inside gossip on all your famous friends ;)
Twitter,2011-12-01T17:07:26+00:00,4,good still new to it but once u get the ppl you follow up some funny things go on there
Twitter,2011-11-29T13:37:37+00:00,5,best community site ever.
Twitter,2011-11-26T20:24:54+00:00,5,never change. Never.
Twitter,2011-11-26T11:08:01+00:00,1,Very disappointed with recent solutions. I don't like tag: activity - I am not interested what my followers were doing, it is now very messy. I hope the website won't follow all the stupid solutions like Facebook does!
Twitter,2011-11-22T12:09:39+00:00,5,Its something so awesome, it definitely helps narrow the gap between the big companies,celebs and groups and also help communicate with them. It is also being used exclusively for professional purposes and most businesses break important news (even post jobs) via twitter these days. The main reason why it works is because its so easy and effective to use.
Twitter,2011-11-20T20:14:40+00:00,4,Am now using twitter for business and find it extreemly usefull as a marketing tool.
Twitter,2011-11-15T14:43:18+00:00,5,If I want to know what's going on in the world I first search on twitter as it is the fastest source for news and changes.
Twitter,2011-11-11T10:31:00+00:00,5,news spreads like a viral, two minutes and boom boom boom.  Best informative site that has ever come on the Internet.
Twitter,2011-11-07T17:06:57+00:00,5,I've been using Twitter for the past couple of months and love it - I get so much of my information (business, news and sport) from this source and I quite like the celebrity chat as well.  I follow my clients on Twitter and have, on at least one occasion, been better informed about the client than a member of the senior management team thanks to Twitter. Really useful and  entertaining.
Twitter,2011-11-02T12:45:47+00:00,1,my identity was compromised and all kinds of unpleasant commercial advertising started to appear under my name. OK it can happen.I asked Twitter customer services for help and for advice. No reply. No help. Nothing.I have deleted my account now - and guess what i get an email saying how much they have missed me!!it all OK with Twitter until it goes wrong and then you are on your own......
Twitter,2011-11-01T22:16:38+00:00,1,I have not and will not use this facility
Twitter,2011-10-27T17:01:45+00:00,5,I love twitter, and unlike other social media it is so simple to get your head around and whilst it evolves it doesn't change massively so it's easy to keep on top of!
Twitter,2011-10-24T14:38:32+00:00,3,I decided to give Twitter a go as everyone seems to be Tweeting nowadays. I find it quite difficult to get my head around and not really much fun. Maybe I was expecting too much from it. I will continue to Tweet occasionally  but it is not exciting enough to keep me gripped.
Twitter,2011-10-24T11:36:49+00:00,4,I left Facebook around a year or so ago because of many privacy issues and also there's too much going on with a Facebook profile. Twitter is so simple to use, it's got clean lines and it's easy to dip in and out of. I find I get so much out of using Twitter and I've convinced many of my family and friends to use it too, I'm concerned that Twitter could go the same way as Facebook eventually! Recently the Facebook 'like' button appeared on Twitter and it freaked me out, so PLEASE Twitter you must realise that you have many ex Facebookers using your website, you wouldn't want to lose us!!
Twitter,2011-10-17T16:26:42+00:00,4,140 words to say what you need to, HmmmNever quite understood Twitter or Tweeting, it seems like a pointless Idea to me, Yes I have an Account that other programs I use Tweet Automatically to, so I hardly ever go on it!!
Twitter,2011-10-06T07:14:46+00:00,5,great to send update of events to all your friends
Twitter,2011-09-13T16:34:30+00:00,5,Very happy with Twitter
Twitter,2011-09-12T15:13:22+00:00,1,Not impressed just away for people to let off steam too much swearing.
Twitter,2011-09-10T01:39:08+00:00,1,I can't really rate it as I have never joined it!! I must be really out of touch , I still ring people and I can text as well, I even go out to the pub and talk to people and I read newspapers, so???? Why? But saying all that after reading all those reviews, I'm going to get or download it, willhave to work out how to do that first!!
Twitter,2011-09-09T09:05:18+00:00,3,Not quite sure what I'm getting from this site, but will persevere until I find it ;)
Twitter,2011-09-07T11:10:34+00:00,4,Love this site, everything I read, every journo and topic I follow, excellent.
Twitter,2011-08-24T12:48:55+00:00,5,i love it to send 140 chars to my followers. great invention. :)
Twitter,2011-08-03T15:10:22+00:00,2,This site is too complicated. I have tried to use it, but it didn't work out.
Twitter,2011-07-29T12:12:42+00:00,5,I have recently tweets some of thoughts in twitter. but i always want to add some picture with this. no doubt it is the best tool for sharing the information, but still i looking for some upgrades.
Twitter,2011-07-28T03:49:55+00:00,4,I like it but there is a lot more to say.  They need to increase their character limits.
Twitter,2011-07-27T13:16:35+00:00,5,ease to use and for advertisement. through this we get quickly response.
Twitter,2011-07-21T07:23:49+00:00,3,i hear of that twitter is so popular around, so i register it, but i found it is difficult to me, i don't know how to post photo, find friends and many other things, oh, i think i am out
Twitter,2011-07-14T03:23:07+00:00,5,It's the most fastest media in the world.
Twitter,2011-07-13T02:55:05+00:00,5,Fed up of being poked on Facebook? Twitter is so much less invasive and personal details do not get shared with others. There is a massive list of sites to follow and you would be hard pushed not to find something of interest. Do you like shouting at the telly when politics or sport is on? Get on Twitter and let others know your opinions and comments, you may be surprised how many people share the same views.
Twitter,2011-07-12T17:32:59+00:00,5,i love twitter its amazing its a lot better than Facebook ill tell you that because its more direct and easy. i can follow people including celebrities to catch up on what they have been up to. you can contact celebs too, whether they reply or not! i love twitter! thank you!
Twitter,2011-07-11T16:02:33+00:00,5,I like twitter because it is simple and straight forward. An easy and simple way to blog I think with those little snippets just good enough to entice you to the bigger story without loads of ads or mumbo jumbo, apart from the spam accounts on there
Twitter,2011-07-04T16:32:24+00:00,3,It's an okay company things could be better
Twitter,2011-06-28T15:09:05+00:00,5,In a way,help users to manage stress by sharing the happenings to the world!
Twitter,2011-06-21T14:31:44+00:00,4,great way to catch up with all the gossip after a hard days work!
Twitter,2011-06-20T17:52:22+00:00,1,to much going on with homepage , not as easy to use as facebook
Twitter,2011-06-19T18:04:01+00:00,4,I'm getting into it now, but didn't quite understand it at first ... It's very complicated whereas facebook has clear instructions as to how to work it ...
